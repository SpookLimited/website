# Spook data centre monitoring

OmniWatch remote monitoring is an early warning system to avoid unplanned downtime and provide trend analysis tools for efficiency gains.

A data centre is a facility that centralises an organisation's shared IT operations and equipment. Because they contain an organisation's most critical and proprietary assets, data centres are vital to the continuity of an organisations daily operations.

Data centres are usually purpose built and contain thousands of servers and associated peripheral systems. Power is paramount and often designed with redundancy built in. Great care is taken to ensure power security in the form of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) and generator sets as well as diverse communication links.

As a consequence data centres are typically power hungry.

Therefore effort is usually placed in measuring power efficiency in the form of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Data Centre Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE) in order to lower lower operating costs.

Data centre service providers need to provide a guaranteed uptime to their users and customers. Real-time monitoring of critical operating conditions can hugely assist in ensuring KPI's are met or exceeded.

## Typical data centre monitoring requirements are:

### Environmental

+ Temperature
+ Humidity
+ Dew point
+ Water ingress
+ Airflow

### Power

+ Mains power
+ UPS supplies
+ Generator sets
+ Intelligent power strips
+ PUE & DCiE

### Security

+ CCTV
+ Door access
+ Cabinet access
