# Humidity monitoring

Measuring Relative Humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained within a volume of air is not fixed.
As air temperature increases the air has the ability to hold more and more water vapour. As air temperature decreases, the air’s ability to hold water decreases.

## Effects of humidity
Relative humidity provides beneficial effects when it is maintained at proper levels and can cause potential problems when it is at a level that’s too high or too low.
The primary benefit in maintaining proper relative humidity levels is a reduction in the ‘charging’ effect that can lead to static electrical discharge by making the air itself just a little more electrically conductive and the surfaces it touches just slightly ‘wet’.
Because of the air’s slight increase in conductivity the imbalance of positive and negative charges that create static electricity are less likely to result in electrical discharges.

| Low humidity | High humidity | Sweet spot |
| ------------ |---------------|------------|
| Low humidity can potentially be a source of static electricity. | High humidity can reduce the chance of static discharge but can cause corrosion of metal components. | Most electrical equipment manufacturers state the best humidity range is typically 20% - 80% for their kit. |
| Every time cool air moves across an ungrounded insulated surface proper humidity levels will cause liquid water to condense upon it. | It can also increase the risk of water damage to electrical equipment. | This is generally true as long as the temperature of the equipment itself and everything around it remains above the dew point temperature. |
| Static electricity can be detrimental to the safe operating of electrical equipment. | | Go here for Spook's free dew point calculator. |

## How can Spook help?
Many organisations already have various ways to measure humidity and use Spook’s remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring humidity from many different sensor manufacturers easy and intuitive.
OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> Our Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units have automatic de-humidification functions. When the humidity becomes too high or too low our CRAC units compensate their settings to adjust the humidity automatically. OmniWatch helps us to ensure humidity levels remain within their expected levels.

> Bedford Borough Council
> Unitary authority of the borough of Bedford.

## Not got humidity monitoring yet?
For organisations that have humidity monitoring requirements but haven’t yet invested in humidity sensors; Spook’s wireless humidity sensors are perfect. They are easy to install and come pre-configured so they only need to be switched on to provide immediate real-time monitoring and alerting.
