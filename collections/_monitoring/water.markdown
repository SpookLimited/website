did-you-know:
  - Impure water conducts electricity whilst pure water does not. Impurities in water dissolve and separate into differently charged atoms called ions. Positive ions are attracted to a negative pole whereas negative ions are attracted to a positive pole and the end result is a closed circuit.
  - Electron transference in water molecules is called the Grotthuss mechanism named after the discoverer, a German chemist called Freiherr Christian Johann Dietrich Theodor von Grotthuss (Theodor Grotthuss).
