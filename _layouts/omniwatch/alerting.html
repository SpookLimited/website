				<p>When a response is received to the alert all customer emergency contacts are emailed confirming matters and the alarm escalation is ceased.</p>

                <h3>Define rotas for contacts, customisable within 1 hour blocks</h3>
				<p>Building on top of the customisable contact information OmniWatch allows for flexible rota functionality. A full week can be planned with contacts being assigned as active or not down to hourly blocks giving full control to the user of who gets what information when.</p>
				<p>Most manufacturer included software will only allow for a single contact to be constantly active and to be configured from the device itself. OmniWatch is designed to work for the end user with the ability to accomodate those who do not follow conventional 9-5 office hours, have staggered or even fully flexable working hours.</p>
				<p>Reduce the time it takes to pass information to the correct person by setting up different contact details for within the office and outside of it. Don't delay information reaching the contact by having their desk phone called in the early hours of the morning.</p>

                <h3>Filter alerts based on location, department or type</h3>
				<p>Large monitoring installations often cover devices or metrics that fall under different departments remits. To ensure that the correct people are contacted quickly and efficiently all sensors, and in turn alarms, can be filtered based on the users requirements.</p>
				<p>A common example would be a user who has several sites being monitored; they don't want to bother the staff of one location about issues with the other and vice versa. Each seperate location can be set up to have their own users and contacts and need not be aware of the others existence.</p>
				<p>Similarly certain hardware could be the responsibility of more than one person and you need to know they are only informed of issues they are in charge of. A third party maintenance company might wish to be alerted to fan and cooling issues with a walk in fridge/freezer but would not need to know about door access outside of office hours.</p>
				<p>Spook works with their users to build a robust and complete custom contact solution for their individual and company requirements so no one is left in the dark if an issue arises.</p>
