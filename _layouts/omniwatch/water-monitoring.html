    <h2>The importance of water ingress monitoring</h2>
    <p>Pipes can burst and air conditioning units and cooling systems can leak from a failed condensate pump, broken supply lines or clogged drains. Sprinkler systems can malfunction too.</p>
    <p>Often a water problem can be festering for some time underneath a raised floor or above a false ceiling. Early detection gives enough lead time to prevent a major shut down.</p>
    <p>Proper placement of water sensors is key. Water tends to puddle at the lowest point of the floor and underneath pipe junctions and air conditioning units. Should a water sensor be placed too high wonâ€™t trigger an alarm until after a serious flood has occurred.</p>
