did-you-know:
  - An early form of alternating current electrical generator was built in 1832 by a French instrument maker called Hippolyte Pixii. Based in Paris, France; Pixii did not fully understand electromagnetic induction, however his alternating current electrical generator was the blue print for many more devices, each gaining more sophistication as they learned from the predecessors.
  - Alternating current changes polarity or direction over time hence its name but it is considered more dangerous than direct current. However, alternating current is much more efficient and makes the transmission of electrical power over great distances very economical.
