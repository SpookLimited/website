	<h3>Installation plans</h3>
	<h1>OmniWatch publishes an installation plan for every monitored location</h1>
	<p>This is important because when an alarm happens, the ability to swiftly identify the offending sensor provides valuable early warnings and thinking time.</p>

	<p>By easily identifying where the physical sensor is within a location means staff can take remedial action before the situation causes bigger problems. For example, a rapid temperature increase of a temperature sensor near an air conditioning unit may indicate a problem that, if left un-noticed, could cause equipment failures or equipment auto shut downs.</p>

	<h2>Installation plan methodology</h2>
	<p>Creating an installation plan can be daunting, but Spook has been doing this for nearly two decades which takes the headache away from our customers. The installation plan does not need to be drawn to scale, but simply be able to reflect the monitored footprint in a way that makes it easy for end users to identify sensors at short notice.</p>
	<h2>Customer designed plans</h2>
	<p>The majority of Spook customers have had an installation plan drawn in the past as part of an overall building plan of a premises. Usually this is a computer room or server room design. Spook can use these to accurately represent the room locations and sensor installations.</p>
	<p>However, over time it's not unusual for rooms to evolve and when this happens a new version needs to be available for reference. Customers can simply hand amend the original plan and send to Spook. Upon amendment Spook uploads and publishes the new installation plans to OmniWatch.</p>
