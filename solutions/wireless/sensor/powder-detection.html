        <p>Spook wireless powder level sensors have an 8 inch or 24 inch solid state ribbon which detects the level of
          powder. As the ribbon is a solid-state sensor it can be used for measuring non-corrosive water based liquids
          too.</p>
        <p>There are no moving parts, for instance it does not have mechanical floats or levers, therefore the sensor is
          not susceptible to wear and tear when compared to traditional powder and fluid sensors.</p>
        <p>The ribbon is made from Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) which is a general-purpose thermoplastic polymer. It
          belongs to the polyester family of polymers which are known for their excellent combination of properties.</p>

          <p>The English chemist John Rex Whinford discovered PET in 1941 whilst researching polymers that could be used
            to make fibres with his colleague James Tennant Dickson. They patented the first polyester fibre which they
            named Terylene three years after Nylon was developed.</p>
