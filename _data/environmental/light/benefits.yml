    - The adverse effects of light and ultaviolet radiation exposure are cumulative. Performing a spot check every day or even every hour simply does not collect enough data to give an accurate account of what is happening in a room or to an item.
    - With OmniWatch, data is collected several times a minute, with any major fluctuations being noted. To give an accurate and easy to understand picture of what is happening readings are taken times of the day and night that can be turned into a report. It's also possible to set up alerts on light levels to instantly inform members of staff of excessive or unwanted exposure and stop items becoming damaged before it's too late.

    - Lights being turned on can also give a good indication that a person is present in a certain area when you are not expecting or wanting them to be.
    - Setting up alerts to track light usage within areas where people are unwanted acts as further security and peace of mind for the protection of valuable and vunerable items.
    - This can of course be run in tandem with boundary and IR sensors, motion detection and conventional door access monitoring to give a more complete picture.
