            <h1>Dew point monitoring</h1>
            <p>Dew point is the temperature at which water vapour in the air starts condensing on the equipment.
                Environments with high relative humidity (RH) and rapid changes in temperature are most likely to
                experience condensing humidity. Dew point is always expressed as a temperature (°C).</p>

        <h2>The importance of dew point monitoring</h2>
        <p>In an unmonitored room containing several air conditioning (AC) units, it is possible to have half the room's
            cooling units adding humidity while the other half work to reduce it. This condition is known as demand
            contention and is one of the primary causes of excessive energy consumption in IT environments.</p>
        <p>By monitoring and controlling dew point and <a href="/omniwatch/humidity-monitoring">relative humidity
                (RH)</a> greatly reduces the frequency of demand contention. This is due to the fact that as air
            increases in temperature in an IT environment its dew point stays the same.</p>
        <p>Most air cooling units simply maintain humidity based on the actual amount of water required in each pound of
            air that passes through the unit. Elimination of demand contention can significantly increase the efficiency
            of the cooling system and save excessive usage of power and fluctuation.</p>

                    <p>We have installed Computer Room Air Conditioning units to ensure air cooling redundancy and to
                        help compensate each other when a unit becomes stressed or less efficient. We found monitoring
                        dew point to be a helpful measurement in order to reduce ‘demand contention’. OmniWatch checks
                        dew point as well as keeping an eye on temperature, this helps ensure our server room is energy
                        efficient.</p>

                <h3>Observing dew point</h3>
                <p>Have you ever drank a glass of ice cold water on a warm day and noticed water droplets collect on the
                    outside of the glass? or have you ever been traveling in a warm car on a very cold day and seen
                    condensation on the inside of the windows or windshield? Then you have definitely observed dew
                    point.</p>
                <h4>Dew point and meteorology</h4>
                <p>Dew point helps meteorologists predict the height of the base of certain types of clouds together
                    with calculating the percentage chance of precipitation. Meteorologists study dew point when
                    checking how moist the air is as relying purely on relative humidity can be misleading.</p>
                <p>Dew point can assist in forecasting overnight low temperatures too. In the majority of cases, the low
                    temperature will not fall too far below the preceding evening's dew point. As temperatures fall
                    towards the dew point, enough heat is released into the atmosphere to cause condensation.</p>
