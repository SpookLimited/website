Waterstones predict Margaret Atwood’s sequel to the Handmaid's Tale, The Testaments, is going to be their biggest release of the year and say it will be their best seller for Christmas 2019.

Spook will help ensure sales are available by monitoring their Piccadilly datacentre in London 24/7 even over the festive period with our award winning monitoring service OmniWatch, helping to keep on-line and in-store sales available for suitably enthusiastic fans.

<blockquote>
<p>We expected The Testaments to be our biggest release of 2019 and it landed in our shops with a suitable bang. It is, predictably, our current bestseller, a position we’d expect it to hold for some time; and we can confidently predict that it will be our fiction bestseller this Christmas.</p>
<p><small>Bea Carvalho, Waterstones fiction buyer.</small></p>
