# Spook facilities monitoring

Disparate equipment monitoring across the whole enterprise.

By definition a Facility is a permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary commercial or industrial property such as a building, plant or structure which is built, established, or installed for the performance of one or more specific activities or functions.

Facilities management is divided into two distinct areas, soft facility management and hard facility management. Spook is used to assist the hard facility management function.

## Hard facilities management

Hard facilities management services are ones which relate to the physical fabric of the building and cannot easily be removed. They ensure the safety and welfare of employees and generally are required by law.

6. Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP)
7. Technical services

> Having Spook monitoring the machine rooms and facilities infrastructure is a key component in managing our sites. Spook is particularly important in monitoring our UPSs and generators to ensure when equipment is tested or indeed invoked we can create audit reports as evidence of matters. OmniWatch provides instant, clear notification of infrastructure failures allowing us to apply rapid interventions to prevent costly outages and loss of service to our customers.
