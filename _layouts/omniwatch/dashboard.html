				<h2>Custom sensor settings</h2>
				<p>Spook recognises similar sensors may need different settings dependant where they are installed. For example a temperature sensor near an air conditioning unit may need lower variables when compared to a similar sensor located near to a heat source.</p>
				<p>All sensor settings are variable and can be easily changed via the individual sensor interface within OmniWatch.</p>
