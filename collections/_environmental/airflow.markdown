title: Airflow monitoring
quote:
  - Our server rooms are spread across London with the main IT rooms being in Hammersmith and our fail-over room is in Canary Wharf. We had a problem with unusual high temperatures in the Canary Wharf location and after some lengthy investigation we realised the air conditioning (AC) filters had become blocked.
  - Although the AC units were working they had become considerably less efficient. By installing air-flow sensors near to the air conditioning outlets we now monitor the strength of airflow as a key element of our preventative maintenance program.
