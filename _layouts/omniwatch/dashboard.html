				<h3>Custom, pre-built and intuitive</h3>
				<h1>OmniWatch real-time responsive dashboards</h1>
				<p>OmniWatch's real-time dashboards are designed to each end users specification on their behalf. The construction is bespoke and as Spook has been doing this for nearly two decades, users can relax, knowing the end result will be intuitive and easy to use.</p>
				<p>There is much more to successful remote monitoring than installing out-of-the-box software as all monitored installations are unique and present their own distinctive dynamics.

		<h2>Omniwatch dashboards are designed and built to give the user instant access to their most important information</h2>
		<p>Spook's aim is to ensure that users are not left in the dark about the health and stability of their business and put that data straight into their hands. OmniWatch supports all modern devices, be it a desktop PC, laptop, tablet or phone, meaning it's available any time or place.</p>
		<p>Dashboards are designed with the input of the end user. Data can be filtered to individual requirements and displayed in a variety of ways; real-time updating current readings, historical comparisons or added functionality and calculations on top of the raw data (see PUE and DCiE, power usage and cost calculations).</p>

		<h2>Singular acccess point</h2>
		<p>OmniWatch is capable of bringing existing monitoring installations together into a single application - no longer making the user reliant on countless different manufacturer interfaces locked to their local network.</p>
		<p>Spook support a large number of hardware manufacturers ranging from household names to small independent hardware producers and are constantly looking to add more to OmniWatch.</p>

		<h2>No existing monitoring or IT infrastructure?</h2>
		<p>It doesn't matter. Spook will work with you to identify what your monitoring needs are, secure the required hardware and install it. With nearly 20 years in the industry Spook is one of the leading experts in all things monitoring and are always expanding existing solutions to cater for each individual requirement and challenge it brings.</p>

				<h2>Access controls</h2>
				<p>The areas that OmniWatch traditionally monitor often spread across several departmental remits which can be difficult to manage or keep secure. For example a refrigeration alarm would need to inform both the maintenance/service company and those that use the equipment on site. Granting and managing access to multiple users in such a case would be time consuming and potentially expose users to information they either don't need or shouldn't see.</p>
				<p>OmniWatch solves this issue and streamlines the workflow for the end user with it's built in access controls. The controls are flexible and can not only be used for sensors and metrics on a single device but also allows for filtering by location, equipment type or however the user wishes.</p>

				<h2>Custom sensor settings</h2>
				<p>Spook recognises similar sensors may need different settings dependant where they are installed. For example a temperature sensor near an air conditioning unit may need lower variables when compared to a similar sensor located near to a heat source.</p>
				<p>All sensor settings are variable and can be easily changed via the individual sensor interface within OmniWatch.</p>
