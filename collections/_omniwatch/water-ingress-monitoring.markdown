# Water ingress monitoring

Fixing a leak before major water damage occurs can save not only a lot of money, but also the potential for loss of personal possessions and unnecessary safety concerns. Water damage can result from a variety of issues, like broken seals, clogged lines, loose connections, excess water pressure and more.

There are a myriad of causes of water ingress and the majority go unnoticed until the resulting influx of water causes problems. Once this happens there is little time to waste in order to remedy the issue and prevent it causing bigger problems.

Even when water leaks have been identified, the drying out process can be laborious and sometimes even dangerous.

## How can Spook help?

Many organisations already have various ways to measure water ingress and use Spook’s remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring water from many different sensor manufacturers easy and intuitive.

OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> We had noticed we are at the mercy of unusual weather patterns. Over recent years it is not unusual for the town to suffer deluges from periods of heavy rain. We have a series on IT and meeting rooms within the town hall that unfortunately have ducts beneath and a specific area on the campus near to one of our data centres that does flood. We installed water sensors in each of these areas in order to keep an eye on matters as well as monitoring the key areas in the various data centres and server rooms. OmniWatch reliably alerts us when these awkward non IT areas are nearing a level that may cause us problems.

## Not got water ingress monitoring yet?

For organisations that have water ingress monitoring requirements but haven't yet invested in water sensors; Spook's wireless water sensors are perfect. They are easy to install and come pre-configured so they only need to be switched on to provide immediate real-time monitoring and alerting.

There are a few types of Spook wireless water sensors available but Spook's wireless water rope sensor is the most popular.
