      <p>The message contains a brief overview of the issue, any recipients have the ability to confirm receipt of the alarm by replying to the SMS, this action ceases the alarm escalation procedure and lets other team members know who has acknowledged the alarm.</p>

        <p>When a response is received to the alert all customer emergency contacts are emailed confirming matters and the alarm escalation is ceased.</p>

                <h3>Customisable contacts</h3>
		<p>Users are able to create and manage as many emergency contacts as required to cover emergency call outs. Spook initially works with customer on-call teams to set an accurate method of emergency contact as a base line.</p>
		<p>After this, each staff member can vary how they are contacted in terms of the times they are on-call and by which methods they choose to be alerted by. Over time this will inevitably evolve and any changes can be reviewed in the <a href="/omniwatch/change-logs">change logs</a> to ensure the alarm process is accurate and up to date.</p>
        <p>Each contact can have multiple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email addresses</li>
          <li>SMS numbers</li>
          <li>Phone numbers, both mobile and landline</li>

                <h3>Define rotas for contacts, customisable within 1 hour blocks</h3>
        <p>Building on top of the customisable contact information OmniWatch allows for flexible rota functionality. A full week can be planned with contacts being assigned as active or not down to hourly blocks giving full control to the user of who gets what information when.</p>
        <p>Most manufacturer included software will only allow for a single contact to be constantly active and to be configured from the device itself. OmniWatch is designed to work for the end user with the ability to accommodate those who do not follow conventional 9-5 office hours, have staggered or even fully flexable working hours.</p>
        <p>Reduce the time it takes to pass information to the correct person by setting up different contact details for within the office and outside of it. Don't delay information reaching the contact by having their desk phone called in the early hours of the morning.</p>

      <h3>Filter alerts based on location, department or type</h3>
      <p>Spook's customers range from single room installations to multiple locations across national and international borders. </p>
      <p>When multi-territory monitoring is required sometimes a regional manager may only need to know what is happening in their district. Whereas the global team may need an enterprise centric view across all regions and territories.</p>
      <p>Even at local level there may be a need for different departments to be responsible for their own monitoring. For example, water ingress monitoring may be the remit of the facilities department whereas the temperature of a room or cabinet may be the responsibility of another department.</p>
      <p>Spook real-time dashboards provide multiple portals to cater for this, whilst ensuring management has a global view of everything.</p>
