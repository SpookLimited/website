# Disaster recovery

Take remedial action before having to invoke disaster recovery plans because prevention is better than cure.

## What is disaster recovery?

Disaster recovery is about getting key IT infrastructure and operations up and running after an unplanned IT outage.

## Spook's OmniWatch monitoring solution - first line of defence for disaster avoidance

A recent poll of Spook customers confirmed that less than 50% tested their disaster recovery plans regularly. They prefer to rely on Spookâ€™s OmniWatch remote monitoring service to be their first line of defence.

## Prevention is better than cure

Spook's ethos of **prevention is better than cure** is as important today as it was when the Spook was established in 2003. As specialists in environmental and power monitoring OmniWatch is chiefly deployed in data centres and IT server rooms.

It is generally well known that the majority of business disruption is caused by unplanned IT downtime. By monitoring the key environmental and power elements of IT rooms, if there is an alarm, remedial action can take place to normalise matters in order to maximise business uptime.

## Critical Alarms > 60%

Over half of OmniWatchâ€™s alarms prove critical, this means users are alerted to issues that could effect their IT uptime at the earliest opportunity. They can take remedial action to stabilise matters before having to invoke their disaster recovery plans.

By knowing there is an issue in the early stages gives valuable thinking and reaction time to busy IT staff. For instance sometimes even the simplest actions like opening doors and windows or installing temporary fans if air conditioning fails and temperatures rise can be enough to get things under control and address the problem.

Typical monitored conditions that can prevent disaster recovery plans needing to be invoked are: 

### Environmental

+ Temperature
+ Humidity
+ Dew point
+ Water ingress 
+ Airflow 

### Power

+ Mains power 
+ UPS supplies
+ Generator sets

> We were alerted to a water leak from a kitchen adjacent to our server room over the weekend. When we arrived on-site the main cold water pipe had burst and was spreading pressurised water from the kitchen to the server room under the false floor. We were able to deal with the problem immediately rather than waiting to face the issue during the working week. We managed to stop the mains incoming water supply and dry out the area over the weekend which minimised disruption for workers as they arrived on Monday morning. We are certain this stopped us needing to invoke our DR procedure.
