- name: Load shedding

  words:
    - Equipment is shut down for certain periods of time on a scheduled basis when it is considered non-essential. A variation of this uses demand readings from utility meters to shut down equipment when instantaneous demand reaches certain levels. 

- name: Time based duty cycling
  color: green

  words:
    - Equipment is shut down periodically for fixed or variable intervals of time during its operating cycle. In a simple time-based control an example would be when the unit is not allowed to operate for a fixed interval out of a given period of time, for example 60 minutes off out of every 120 minutes on. 

- name: Temperature based duty cycling
  color: red

  words:
    - When the controller overrides the thermostat for heating or cooling, so for extended periods the unit is cycled according to these preset on/off settings. Alternatively the equipment uses thermostats to implement the off-periods, for example, the off-period is invoked if the thermostat is satisfied during a cycle and vice versa. 

- name: Price based load control
  color: orange

  words:
    - Direct load is controlled where thermostat control set-points are offset based on pricing signals sent by the utility. Using this method the user can decide how much energy cost is expired at any particular time.
