				<p>Spook wireless light meters measure the intensity of light from 0â€“83,000 LUX (luminescence/unit area), plus an optional detection reading of light/no light. By default, the detection reading is triggered on LUX value being above or below the configured minimum threshold value of the sensor.</p>
				<p>The wireless light meter uses a highly sensitive photo-diode to detect and measure the intensity of light around the device. The sensor is also capable of alerting upon detection of a change in lighting conditions.</p>
