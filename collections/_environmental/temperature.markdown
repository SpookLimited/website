title: Temperature monitoring
words:
  - Temperature monitoring is an important measurement for climate control and is perhaps the most commonly measured condition of all environmental states.
  - Whether you need to know if it's too hot, too cold or simply that there is a rapid change; measuring the activity of temperature is key to climate monitoring.
quote:
  - We were experiencing unusual temperature fluctuations in our server room and comms room over weekends.
  - We compared the trend data of our temperature sensors over a 12-month period with the help of OmniWatch's on-demand report function and spotted trends over the weekends whereby our IT rooms suffered regular unplanned increases in temperature.
  - We could create a report showing this trend data and share that with the Facilities team in-order to illustrate the problem and resolve matters.
