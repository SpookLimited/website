        <h1>Wireless propane tank level sensor</h1>
        <h3>Industrial</h3>
        <p>Spook's wireless propane tank level sensor monitors the level of a propane in a tank or container. As the
          propane level reduces, so does the reading. The sensor converts the reading into a percentage of propane
          remaining in the tank.</p>
        <p>The sensor assumes that the container is uniform in width to ensure accurate propane level monitoring. If the
          propane level falls to below approximately 10% it will report empty. If the propane level is above 80% then
          the sensor reports full.</p>
        <p>When the propane liquid gets cold enough the tank next to the liquid gets colder than the tank next to the
          air above. The magnets of the sensor measure the temperature of the tank rather than directly measuring the
          actual liquid level.</p>
        <p class="is-muted">Note: a R3D gauge is required for the sensor to operate, these can be retro-fitted if the
          tank does not already have one. The Rochester Remote Ready Dial, R3D® – LP, is a magnetically-driven, Hall
          Effect compatible dial.</p>

          <p>The Hall-effect is named after the physicist Edwin Hall who discovered the effect while he was studying a
            doctoral degree at University. In 1879 he discovered that when a conductor or semiconductor with current
            flowing in one direction was introduced perpendicular to a magnetic field a voltage could be measured at
            right angles to the current path.</p>
