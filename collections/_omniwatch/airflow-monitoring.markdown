# Airflow monitoring

Air behaves in a fluid manner, meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower. The movement of air is key for ventilation so ensuring air ducts are not restricted or inefficient is key.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 measuring airflow and ensuring clean air is in circulation has become more critical. However, reasons for airflow monitoring range from the critical to the mundane. For instance knowing air conditioning units are becoming less efficient for cooling purposes means filter changes and maintenance visits may need to be organised.

By monitoring airflow these actions can be left to be performed when issues arise in an informed way and by doing so; maximises the longevity of air handling units.

## How can Spook help?

Many organisations already have various ways to measure airflow and use Spook's remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring airflow easy and intuitive.

OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> Our server rooms are spread across London with the main IT rooms being in Hammersmith and our fail-over room is in Canary Wharf. We had a problem with unusual high temperatures in the Canary Wharf location and after some lengthy investigation we realised the air conditioning (AC) filters had become blocked. Although the AC units were working they had become considerably less efficient. By installing air-flow sensors near to the air conditioning outlets we now monitor the strength of airflow as a key element of our preventative maintenance program.

## Not got airflow monitoring yet?

For organisations that have airflow monitoring requirements but haven't yet invested in airflow sensors; Spook's wireless airflow sensors are perfect. They are easy to install and come pre-configured so they only need to be switched on to provide immediate real-time monitoring and alerting.

There are a few types of Spook wireless airflow sensors available but Spook's differential air pressure sensor is the most popular.
