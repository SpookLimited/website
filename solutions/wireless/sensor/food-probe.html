        <h3>AAA</h3>
        <p>
          Spook's wireless food probe measures the temperature of solid or liquid foods to ensure they are safe for
          human
          consumption.
        </p>

        <p>The sensor has a needle probe and measures temperatures up to 260°C (500°F).</p>

        <p>
          The food probe uses an RTD temperature probe to provide long-term, highly accurate temperature readings. The
          sensor has
          an onboard display and buttons. When the buttons are pressed the sensor will provide a new temperature reading
          and its
          value can be sent to OmniWatch.

            Restaurants are legally required to comply with the food regulations in the respective locations where they
            operate.
            These regulations are set by HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point).
          </p>

          <p>
            Restaurants need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the quality of their food is maintained, especially
            considering
            that the food will be consumed by the public.
