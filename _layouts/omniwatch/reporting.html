	<h1>what are reports?</h1>
	<p>OmniWatch's on-demand report function is an easy to use management accessory which converts the real-time collected sensor readings and equipment metrics being monitored and presents them in handy bite sized or custom designed time frames.</p>
	<p>Collected sensor readings are converted to charts showing the trend data for like-for-like readings regardless of the origin of the data. This takes the hassle out of trying to compare similar reading across disparate equipment types.</p>

    <h2>Climate monitoring reports</h2>
    <p>By understanding the environmental pressures and operating conditions of an area by monitoring temperature, humidity and dew point means pro-active management policies can be adopted.</p>
    <p>For example, comparing temperature readings from climate monitors, UPS systems, intelligent power strips and even rack mounted versus ambient room temperature sensors is simple. This applies to all sensor types which can be grouped together.</p>
    <p>Cooling is a huge beneficiary of accurate monitoring. By being able to measure temperature fluctuations, cases can be made for upgrading air conditioning units or simply managing an active maintenance program by spotting when cooling systems become less efficient and managing filter changes etc. Cooling has a direct impact on the longevity of electrical equipment such as servers but is equally important in understanding non-it related demands of cooling such as measuring the efficiency of fridges and freezers.</p>

    <h2>Power monitoring reports</h2>
    <p>Power monitoring and load balancing measurements can be applied to various types of equipment. When measuring power metrics, intuitive comparisons can be made for amps, kWh, stranded power and any variety of power measurement. This means a true measurement of power efficiency gains can be captured across any time frame. This is extremely helpful in applying active load balancing exercises or auto-calculating the stranded power (spare power available) before having to invest in power expansion programs.</p>

	<h2>what's in a report?</h2>
	<p>Included within the report is a summary of every monitored condition with a record of:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Maximum reading</li>
	  <li>Minimum reading</li>
	  <li>Average reading</li>
	  <li>Number of readings</li>
	  <li>How many alarms have been generated per sensor</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A summary of each alarm can be interrogated showing each one in detail, including who were sent the alarms, which escalation stage they reached (email, SMS and Spook call centre) together with the detail of who, within the team, reacted to the alarm.</p>
	<p>It's important to keep a track on any changes to the set-up of OmniWatch. All changes are date and time stamped together with cataloging the reason for the amendment and who applied them. This is critical to understanding why changes have been applied from simply amending the high temperature trigger point of a temperature sensor to tracking a rota change or updating an email address of a key contact.</p>

    <h2>Trend data</h2>
    <p>Studying the trend data within the reports can be influential in future proofing the monitored area. For example, by studying the power load of individual power strips can assist in proactive load balancing projects; or by checking the cooling efficiency of air conditioning units can help maintenance processes or provide valuable information to support equipment upgrades.</p>

    <h2>Protect warranties</h2>
    <p>Most equipment comes with a manufacturers recommendation for the optimum operating condition of the kit. The ability to prove, under audit conditions, all recommendations are met means warranties can't be questioned and any replacements required during the warranty cover can be called upon in confidence.</p>
