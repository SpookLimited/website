        <h3>Damage to equipment</h3>
        <p>Power loss can have negative effects outside of the obvious loss of work or services. Devices such as computers and servers are constantly active and working even if a user has not asked it to do anything. Important system files could be being worked on by the computer when power loss occurs permanently corrupting or destroying the file.</p>
        <h3>Power source switch over</h3>
        <p>Even if a site has generators there is a delay between loss of power and a generator being switched on. UPSs are used to ensure there is no loss of power during the switch over from mains power to generator power.</p>

        <h2>Maximise your investment</h2>
        <p>Most modern UPS systems have the ability to have a communications card installed within it that allow for third party solutions to connect and share metrics and usage data.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch is capable of monitoring these cards and their UPSs, either through SNMP, Modbus, BACnet or other protocols. Spook is constantly working to increase the number of supported devices and communications protocols to allow for a singular cloud based solution and not force users to be reliant on local only web interfaces.</p>
        <p>Even UPSs that are not able to be network attached can be added to a user's monitoring footprint as there is usually a facility to connect to a Voltage Free Connection (VFC) panel to monitor a wide-range of conditions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="is-col black white-text is-30 is-inset-20">
        <p>When using a VFC there are two types of condition to monitor, Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC).</p>
        <p>Spook recommends setting equipment to NO when the alarm status is within the normal operating mode.</p>
        <p>Therefore, if the interconnecting cable connecting the sensor to the monitoring unit is cut or becomes loose, the sensor will send an alarm.</p>

        <h2>UPS environmental monitoring</h2>
        <p>Monitoring the environment of a UPS is as important as monitoring the temperature of a server room.</p>
        <p>Many UPSs have battery banks associated with them. These battery banks contain individual batteries that require the ambient environment to be within the guidelines of the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>It's important to be able to prove the operating environment of a UPS and associated batteries in order to maintain its warranty protection.</p>

          <p>We could keep an eye on each power phase as well as knowing the time remaining on each UPS. Afterwards we could produce audit reports to prove to management that our UPS systems continued seamless power provision in accordance with our plans.</p>
