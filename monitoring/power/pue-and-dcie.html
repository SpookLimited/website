        <h2>What is PUE and DCiE?</h2>
        <p>PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and DCiE (Data Centre infrastructure Effectiveness) are industry standard efficiency benchmarks comparing the overall energy used for a data centers infrastructure versus its energy used for its existing IT load.</p>
        <p>By measuring PUE and DCiE presents an efficiency score and sets a testing framework for the data center to repeat and compare. By continually comparing scores, data center managers can verify the impact of what should be the focus of their ongoing efficiency efforts in order to gain greater cost savings and efficiencies in the future.</p>
        <p>At any given time, they are comparing the power currently used for the IT equipment needs with the power used by the infrastructure as a whole which keeps that IT equipment cooled, powered, backed-up and protected.</p>

        <h2>The benefits of PUE and DCiE monitoring</h2>
        <p>Knowing what the efficiency figures are in real-time is allows users to highlight areas for improvement in order to to achieve better ratings over time.</p>
        <p>The objective is to ensure that the maximum possible percentage of power utilised in a data center is actually used by IT equipment and the minimum by supporting equipment such as AC units and other peripheral equipment.</p>
        <p>Understanding PUE and DCiE is only the beginning. Efficiency gains should be regularly calculated, preferably in real time. By doing this users can check how well they are doing on different days of the week, month and year. This is particularly important as it identifies equipment overheads that may be missed if the measurements are made infrequently.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Perpetuity of data</h2>
    <p>Spook retains all PUE and DCiE readings in perpetuity so users can study trends for efficiency more accurately. The results can easily be exported in OmniWatch on-demand reports.</p>
