- title: Security
  words:
      - Heritage organisations often tread the fine line between public enjoyment and protection of valuable assets.
      - Grade listed buildings, exhibition spaces and areas with delicate fabrics and wall coverings all need to manage the difficult balance between members of the public viewing them and the organisation conserving them providing adequate protection.

        words:
            - For important or irreplaceable items a small activity detection sensor is available. Spook’s wireless activity sensors can be used to determine if assets is removed from the premises, or just moved in general.
            - Any vibration or sudden movement would cause an alarm. Activity sensors are ideal to place on protective glass covering exhibits. Any unexpected movement of the glass is usually indicative of intruder or theft.

        words:
            - Spook wireless open/closed sensors provide information on the status of doors, windows, cabinets, etc. Knowing if doors or windows are open is an important feature.
            - Cabinets and rooms that contain secure items may also need to be monitored.

        words:
            - These sensors are ideal for areas that need to allow viewing platforms or areas to members of the public and to protect restricted boundaries. Often these areas are simply protected with a perimeter rope and exhibition security staff are employed to ensure no one intrudes beyond the permitted area.
            - By installing Spook wireless open/closed sensors to IR beams and pressure pads, any vulnerable area can be monitored with ease. Alerts can be discretely sent to security staff within the vicinity. This ensures public viewing of exhibits remain calm and members of the public are not unduly panicked while enjoying their visit should someone inadvertently or purposely stray over a monitored sensor.

- title: Water ingress
  words:
      - Water ingress has the ability to cause damage in a matter of seconds. Spook's range of wireless water sensors are ideal to monitor for water ingress. Whether it is water leaks from overhead pipework or leaking air conditioning (AC) units, all have the ability to cause substantial damage.
      - Older properties, especially ones that are Grade listed or protected often have old pipework, leaky roofs and boiler rooms that may need monitoring. By installing Spook wireless water sensors in areas of concern means any unseen leaks can be addressed quickly.
      - Spook has an array of wireless water sensors designed for detecting water ingress immediately.

        words:
            - The water detection rope uses two wires covered with conducting polymer to detect the presence of water or other fluids. When a fluid passes over the two internal wires a short circuit is detected and <a href="/omniwatch/alerting/">an alert</a> is sent by OmniWatch.

- title: Light (LUX - luminescence/unit area)
  words: 
      - Galleries and viewing areas are often lit to set the appropriate mood, there are usually special requirements to ensure images, pictures and fabrics remain pristine. Spook wireless light meters are a perfect solution to track LUX to help avoid accidental lighting mistakes.
      - Light needs to be managed, whether it is with automatic dimmers or by the more conventional method of staff entering an area to close blinds to prevent sun damage.
      - Because Spook's OmniWatch monitoring service retains Spook sensor readings in perpetuity, reports can be produced to study long-term trend data. Analysis can be gained to predict light patterns at different times of day, season or even year. By understanding the cyclical changes to light means planning and building LUX routines is achievable.

        words:
            - Many heritage organisations have areas that are sensitive to light. Sometimes they have a specified Light Budget. Spook wireless light sensors are ideal for tracking and managing Lux Hours.

- title: Temperature
  words:
    - Spook wireless temperature sensors come in a few options. Ambient temperature sensors are compact and sealed in the body of the sensor but variations are available in the form of various temperature probes.
    - The Association of Independent Museums (AIM) highlights the importance of maintaining stable temperatures. Fluctuating temperatures cause greater damage to the collections than achieving a constant level.

        words:
            - Heritage organisations sometimes struggle between keeping temperatures low for exhibited collections while the exhibition spaces are generally heated to accommodate members of the public. Typical temperature ranges for human comfort levels is around 17-21°C. However, storage of items can be kept at lower temperatures to slow down degradation.

- title: Humidity
  words:
    - Spook wireless humidity sensors measure the Relative Humidity (RH) in an area.
    - AIM recommends RH to be maintained as closely as possible within a 20% variance. This allows for daily and annual seasonal changes to be taken into account.
    - Picture frames shrinking, textiles becoming brittle, paint on canvas flaking and furniture joints loosening are all symptoms of a dry atmosphere. When these effects occur in a museum or art gallery the results can be catastrophic.

            - The water detection rope uses two wires covered with conducting polymer to detect the presence of water or other fluids. When a fluid passes over the two internal wires a short circuit is detected and an alert is sent by OmniWatch.
            - Commonly used bands are 40%-60% or 45%-65%. However, acceptable levels may vary depending on what is achievable locally and that which best suits the needs of the particular items in the heritage collections.
