        <p class="is-big">Energy monitoring is the process of measuring energy consumption for the whole or part of a facilities incoming power. By measuring the incoming energy means granular consumption can be understood too, from energy sub-sets to individual assets.</p>
        <p class="is-big">Monitoring power consumption and having the ability to analyse trend data over long periods of time means efficiency gains or losses can be accurately identified.</p>

      <p>Spook monitors our energy consumption by collecting metrics from our various Schneider PowerLogic PM800 series power meters installed across our data centre estate.</p>
      <p>We now accurately measure the power consumption per phase in real-time ranging from Amps, kW, kWh and other important power metrics.</p>
      <p>We can create Spook Smart Sensors to aggregate usage where necessary in order to help us ensure energy security, pro-active load-balancing and to apply power efficiency calculations in-line with our sustainability policy KPI's.</p>

        <h2>Can energy monitoring reduce consumption?</h2>
        <p>The opportunity of reducing energy consumption by measuring it and understanding how a facilities energy interdependencies work only comes with understanding granular energy trend data.</p>
        <p>For example, monitoring a building’s energy consumption could highlight inefficiencies such as excessively heating a vacant area, constantly providing lighting and other power hungry activities such as cooling and ventilation.</p>
        <p>Commercial buildings are typically noted for their energy inefficiency. Offices usually have open spaces that require a lot of heating to fill the space alongside an excessive amount of lighting. When you consider that the CO<sub>2</sub> impact of electricity consumption is 2.5 times greater than that of natural gas exasperates the situation.</p>

        <h2>Is energy monitoring important?</h2>
        <p>Energy monitoring is important as it is the process of making energy consumption efficient, from buildings or campus to individual assets across the facility such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and air conditioning) and more.</p>
        <p>Energy monitoring is vital in helping to control and conserve energy now and in the future. Energy inefficiencies can be identified enabling organisations time to implement changes to reduce energy consumption and as a consequence increase cost savings.</p>

        <h2>Granular monitoring</h2>
        <p>Energy bills are simply broken down to usage and cost over a given period of time. However, there is typically no analysis available to identify where sub-sets of the usage occur. Therefore, it doesn’t provide energy managers with the appropriate information they need to make data-driven decisions.</p>
        <p>The Carbon Trust suggest that approximately 20% of all business related energy costs are wasted through inefficient equipment. Therefore, by monitoring energy consumption down to asset level means an equipment’s performance and energy output can be identified and alerts can be generated when these become less efficient.</p>

            <h3>Real time monitoring</h3> 
            <p>Energy monitoring only becomes effective when it is conducted in real-time. Labour costs associated with staff taking regular measurements throughout the day can be totally eliminated.</p>
            <p>When assets fail, instant alarms can be sent to remedy the situation before excessive amounts of energy is wasted.</p>
            <p>In addition, the continuous monitoring and analysis of equipment data means predictive maintenance can take place, so assets can continue to operate efficiently at all times with fewer failures.</p>

            <h3>Peaks and troughs</h3>
            <p>Real-time energy monitoring makes it easier to identify trends such as energy peaks and nadirs.</p>
            <p>By reviewing energy trends over the course of a given time period presents the best options to reduce consumption and possible re-scheduling options in order to minimise usage.</p>
            <p>Spook's real-time energy monitoring is completely scaleable, meaning monitoring single buildings or an entire estate of facilities can be achieved in an enterprise centric solution.</p>

        <h3>Maximising energy efficiency</h3>
        <p>Energy efficiency is extremely beneficial in helping to reduce the cost of the bottom line or limiting an organisations impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>The cost of providing energy across all sectors is increasing at an eye watering level. This is caused by our over-reliance on fossil fuels, the return to pre-Covid levels of energy consumption and energy insecurity.</p>
        <p>Obviously operating more efficiently reduces energy consumption, meaning significant savings can be achieved on utility bills. For example, by applying effective energy management to an industrial or commercial building presents the potential to save thousands each year.</p> 
        <p>According to the Department of Energy & Climate Change, the average SME (Small to Medium Enterprise) could reduce its energy bills by up to 25% by installing energy efficiency measures which could achieve an average payback of less than 1.5 years.</p>

        <h3>Government initiatives</h3>
        <p>With increases in energy prices predicted to rise by more than 50% in the next 5 years and the government introducing carbon reduction goals, many organisations are prioritising energy efficiency projects.</p>
        <p>The Government is also providing grants for SME's with funding worth almost £5 billion<b>*</b> to help UK businesses become greener as part of the government's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
