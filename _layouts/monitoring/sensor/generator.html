			<p>We monitor our diesel generator to enable us to present key operating status metrics while it is in use. The generator is some distance from our IT department so knowing when it is running as well as identifying important information like fuel level, auto-start, low battery, at rest and fault are valuable data. Spook OmniWatch helps prove our ‘fail over’ tests to support our departmental and achieve our Key Performance Indicators(KPI’s).</p>

		<h2>The benefits of generator monitoring</h2>
		<p>Most businesses know the importance of installing a diesel generator (generator) as an emergency source of electrical power. Often referred to as power redundancy, generators provide important mid to long term electrical power upon the loss of normal power supply.</p>

		<p>Investment in a generator is usually twinned with installing an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS monitoring). Whereas a UPS is designed to provide seamless power for a short period of time while IT systems can be managed and shut down, generators provide a reliable source of back-up emergency power for longer periods of time.</p>

		<h2>Power redundancy</h2>
		<p>A generator provides secure interim power redundancy if a power grid suffers an outage. This power redundancy allows businesses to maintain their operations, hospitals to retain use of their instruments and airports to preserve system integrity.</p>
		<p>Any organisation that controls mission critical applications can benefit from having a generator available as a reliable power source.</p>
		<p>Generators provide a continuous stream of voltage power without the peaks and dips of other devices, thus helping to regulate fluctuations. They are designed for continual use.</p>

		<h2>Avoiding potential damage</h2>
		<p>It is not a well known fact but the less energy expended by the diesel generator, the shorter it lasts.</p>
		<p>When generators are used at less than 70% of capacity, it places excess wear on the engine.</p>

		<h2>Dangers of under-loading</h2>
		<p>One of the most common causes of damage to generators is when they’re under-loaded. That is, generators function most effectively when they’re operating at high capacity. When they’re used for low capacity tasks (such as powering 10% of the voltage load), they can start to build up carbon and internal glazing.</p>
		<p>Eventually, soot and residue from unused fuel can accumulate and clog the generator’s piston rings.</p>
		<p>The longer this happens, the more pronounced the degradation of the diesel generator’s system. To avoid this, generators should have a capacity at approximately 70% of the maximum load.</p>

		<h2>UPS intervention</h2>
		<p>One effective strategy for accomplishing this is to use a UPS for short-term emergencies. Then, have a diesel generator available for long-term outages.</p>
		<p>Though generators tend to be expensive, their value as a dependable source of electricity can make them a worthwhile investment.</p>

		<h2>Network cards and Voltage Free Contacts</h2>
		<p>Modern generators have network cards or Voltage Free Connection (VFC) panels to monitor key operating conditions.</p>
		<p>Typical generator monitoring measures:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Voltage</li>
			<li>Frequency</li>
			<li>Oil temperature</li>
			<li>Water temperature</li>
			<li>Battery condition</li>
			<li>Emergency stop (EPO) status</li>
			<li>Fuel levels</li>
		</ul>
