        <h1>Wireless soil moisture sensor</h1>
        <h3>Industrial</h3>
        <p>
          Spook's wireless soil moisture sensor measures soil water tension (matric potential) and temperature. Soil
          matric
          potential (SMP) is considered the best way for measuring soil water availability to plants as it constitutes
          the force
          with which water is held by soil matrix (soil particles and pore space).
        </p>

        <p>
          The sensor has a thermistor-based temperature too with a range of -40°C to 125°C (-40°F to 257°F). The soil
          moisture
          sensor uses a resistive granular matrix element to accurately measure the matric water potential (soil
          moisture tension)
          in the soil.

    <h3>Soil Moisture Element</h3>

    <p>
      The soil moisture element is unique in that it takes its resistive measurement within a defined and consistent
      internal
      matrix material, rather than using the surrounding soil as the measurement medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      This lets the sensor have a stable and consistent calibration that does not need to be established for every
      installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Temperature Element</h3>
    <p>
      The sensor also has a temperature element too. The temperature reading is used for temperature compensation of the
      soil
      moisture measurements and compensates for different moisture readings as the temperature changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed for use in hot and freezing temperatures</li>
      <li>Measurement range of 0 to 240 centibar (cb) or kilopascal (kPa)</li>
      <li>Made from high grade steel making it corrosion-resistant</li>
      <li>Internally compensated for commonly found salinity levels</li>
      <li>Easy to install and use compared to traditional tensiometers</li>
    </ul>

            The bar is a metric unit of pressure and is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 Pa (100 kPa), or slightly
            less than the
            current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level.
          </p>

          <p>
            The bar and the millibar were invented by the Norwegian physicist and meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes. From
            1926 to his
            retirement in 1932 he held a position at the University of Oslo. He was elected a member of the Royal
            Swedish Academy of
            Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the
            1932 Symons
            Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society.
