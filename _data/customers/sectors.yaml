      - Spook monitors the IT environments and power resources within our server rooms in the UK and in our Sofia location in Bulgaria. By monitoring power at power strip level means we can pro-actively measure power consumption centrally and deploy informed load balancing procedures to the business. We also monitor key power metrics of our various UPS systems and water ingress via third party water panels linked to Spook’s OmniWatch monitoring service.

We always felt relying on technology to contact us was flawed but with Spook they have developed an excellent tiered approach that means we are contacted even if emails and SMS message fail.

Spook provided pre-configured cellular routers for each of our five data centers. The whole project was a simple plug-and-play solution with little or no involvement from us which left us to concentrate on other pressing matters. We were pleased on how Spook ran with the project as it was in December and we needed a service in place before year end. Once the cellular routers were powered up, we had instant access to our secure digital dashboards. We remain impressed with the ease of the whole process provided for by Spook.
