  link: /monitoring/power/ups
  description:
    - UPS units are usedÂ to protect critical power loads from utility-supplied power problems, including spikes, brownouts, fluctuations and power outages. UPS units use dedicated batteries to provide seamless power in the event of a mains power outage. Most UPS systems are designed to provide relatively short amounts of power as diesel generators are invoked to provide more long term secure power.

- name: Intelligent power distribution units (iPDU)

  description:
    - By monitoring power consumption at PDU level an organisation can measure power consumption to asset level. Bring aware of real-time power usage means informed load balancing procedures can be implemented to prevent power overloads and protect service outages due to loss off power.

- name: Energy meters
  icon: /images/icons/peak-load.svg
  link: /monitoring/power/energy-meters
  description:
    - Energy meter monitoring is the process of measuring energy consumption for the whole or part of a facilities utility incoming power.
    - By measuring the incoming energy means granular consumption can be understood too, from energy sub-sets to individual assets.

- name: Diesel generators
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/generator.svg
  link: /monitoring/power/generator
  description:
    - Generators provide a continuous stream of voltage power and are designed for continual use. Any organisation that controls mission critical applications can benefit from having a generator available as a reliable power source.
    - Understanding core generator metrics in realtime ensures power security is maintained.

- name: PUE and DCiE
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/pue-dcie.svg
  link: /monitoring/power/pue-and-dcie
  description:
    - PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and DCiE (Data Centre infrastructure Effectiveness) are industry standard efficiency benchmarks comparing the overall energy used for a data centers infrastructure versus its energy used for its existing IT load.
    - By measuring these efficiency benchmarks in realtime means ongoing efforts to gain the best ratings can be achieved.
