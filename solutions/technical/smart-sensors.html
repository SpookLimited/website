    <h2>Introduction to smart sensors</h2>
    <p>Spook have developed smart sensors to build upon traditional sensor readings and present data in a more
      comprehensive and informative way. Smart sensors
      can be used to perform <a href="#complex-calculations">complex calculations</a> or create a <a
        href="#additional-sensor-creation">pseudo sensor</a> to add
      additional metrics not present or
      available with traditional monitoring solutions.</p>
    <p>With the use of smart sensors within OmniWatch users are able to <a href="#combine-sensor">combine</a>, <a
        href="#compare-sensor">compare</a>
      and <a href="#group-device-monitoring">monitor devices</a> in a more
      meaningful way. Hardware and sensors are no longer treated as isolated pieces of equipment but as a part of a
      monitoring solution.</p>

        <h2>Confirm machinary activity within complex and nontraditional configurations</h2>
        <p>There are often times where multiple pieces of equipment perform the same job but don't need to be active at
          the
          same time. An example would be air conditioning (AC) units that are on duty rotation and only one is active at
          a
          time in order to maximises the lifetime of each system while also increasing efficiency.</p>

            when all units are

        </figure>
        <p>With conventional monitoring incorrect alerts would be generated whenever a unit switches from active to
          inactive as each unit is treated separately with no knowledge of the others. By creating a smart sensors
          within OmniWatch users area able to track the planned rotation cycles and be alerted to any unplanned activity
          which could cause service disruption.</p>

          <h3>Duty cycle types</h3>
          <ol class="is-small">
            <li>
              <strong>Load shedding</strong> - equipment is shut down for certain periods of time on a scheduled basis
              when it
              is considered non-essential. A variation
              of this
              uses demand readings from utility meters to shut down equipment when instantaneous demand reaches certain
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time based duty cycling</strong> - equipment is shut down periodically for fixed or variable
              intervals
              of time during its
              operating cycle. In a
              simple time-based control, the unit is not allowed to operate for a fixed interval out of a given period
              of
              time, for
              example 60
              minutes off out of every 120 minutes on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature based duty cycling</strong> - when the controller overrides the thermostat for heating
              or
              cooling, so for extended
              periods the
              unit is cycled according to these preset on/off settings. Alternatively equipment uses thermostats to
              implement
              the
              off-periods. For
              example, the off-period is invoked if the thermostat is satisfied during a cycle and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Price based load control</strong> - direct load is controlled where thermostat control set-points
              are
              offset based on pricing signals sent
              by the utility.
              Using this method the user can decide how much energy cost is expired at any particular time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimal start/stop</strong> - sdelays equipment startup or shutdown to take advantage of thermal
              lags in
              building structures.

        <h2>Generate an aggregate sensor from multiple devices</h2>
        <p>Within a monitoring installation not all sensors are critical, some are purely informational and although
          these typically do not have
          an alert associated with them, the data they present can be used
          meaningfully.
        <p>An example of this is power consumption of PDUs which can be used to keep an eye on
          demand
          and costs. Smart sensors can be used to track overall power consumption or into user defined areas such as
          buildings,
          rooms, racks or departments.</p>
        <p>By combining multiple readings into a singular total OmniWatch gives its users the ability to group, compare
          and
          monitor any number of singular devices into something more meaningful while still preserving the underlying
          metrics if required.</p>

        <h2>Average a collection of sensor readings into a singular metric</h2>
        <p>When monitoring a number of similar sensors knowing the average can be
          helpful. Smart sensors within OmniWatch can easily perform this task with any sensors from any number of
          devices.</p>
        <p>For example, when monitoring the temperature within a room sensors could be located in naturally hot or cold
          locations. Though
          useful when monitoring localised environmental conditions it doesn't give an overview of the health of the
          room as
          whole.</p>
        <p>Combining and averaging sensors will give an actionable metric that can be monitored to prevent
          issues that have the potential for larger impact across a user's installation.</p>

        <h4 class="brand-header">Delta temperature monitoring</h4>
        <h2>Keep an eye on temperature differences within racks and monitor cooling efficiency</h2>
        <p>Many organisations will use temperature probes to monitor the temperatures of individual racks.
          There are several different methodologies to consider for rack based thermal management:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ASHRAE</strong> recommend at least 6 temperature probes placed at the top, middle and bottom of a
            rack both at the front and rear.</li>
          <li><strong>Gartner</strong> suggest at least 3 temperature probes. One placed at the base of the rack at the
            front to capture air intake, top of the front of the rack to ensure intake air reaches the equipment
            correctly and at the top of the rear of the rack to measure the hottest point.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimum</strong> requirements to monitor a rack effectively is one temperature probe at the bottom
            front of the rack and one at the top rear of the rack to capture the outtake temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, when a heat issue occurs it is often hidden at first by air conditioning (AC) units compensating and
          is often only spotted when they are no longer able to keep up or fail.</p>
        <p>Creating a smart sensor to calculate
          the delta temperature (Δt) within a rack can give an early warning to
          air cooling issues sooner than conventional monitoring. This is done by comparing the rack level air intake
          temperature to the outtake air temperature and allowing for extra alert triggers to be placed when the Δt
          strays outside of the accepted limits (±20°C).</p>

    <h2>Use existing monitored sensor readings to enable monitoring of new metrics</h2>
    <p>When monitoring a device it is sometimes beneficial to monitor metrics that aren't readily available or provided
      by the equipment. Creating a smart sensor to log data for a metric that doesn't exist can boost insight into what
      is happening within an installation. These smart sensors can be generated through combining or performing a
      calculation on existing metrics either from an individual or multiple devices.</p>
    <div class="is-row">
      <div class="is-col">
        <p>Intelligent PDUs often give you the basic 3 metrics of amps, volts and kWhs
          but to fully understand usage and plan new equipment deployment it is advisable to monitor stranded power.</p>
        <p>Stranded power is the amount of power a PDU is capable of delivering but is not; the higher the amount of
          stranded power the less a PDU is being utilised.</p>
        <p>When positioning new equipment it's best to use the least utilised PDU to supply power and this information
          is available instantly through OmniWatch. The impact of the additional devices can also be monitored in
          real-time to ensure that no demand spikes or irregular power consumption threaten operational uptime.</p>

        <h2>Spook's smart sensors can do complex calculations using multiple devices in many locations</h2>
        <p>When a large number of metrics and devices are monitored the collected data can often be used to increase the
          level of insight by performing extra calculations and building upon the existing footprint.</p>
        <p>With a large installation, such as a data center, it is common practice to monitor a variety of power metrics
          such as the power feed to the building, UPSs, generators, PDUs, etc. Each of these devices are monitored so
          that
          the user will receive an alert the moment a power issues happens no matter where within their building it
          occurs.</p>
        <p>However, with these individual metrics it is possible to perform a calculation for the power usage
          effectiveness
          (PUE) and data center infrastructure efficiency (DCiE). By tracking the PUE and DCiE of an installation users
          are
          able to track down and reduce overhead, in the case of wasted power, and be presented with a real-time impact
          graph.</p>
        <p>By pairing a <a href="#combine-sensor">combine smart sensor</a> with a calculation sensor a user is able to
          get an estimated cost of power usage within their installation by simply supplying the cost per kW that their
          provider charges them. OmniWatch can also take peak and off-peak hourly charges into consideration when
          generating
          the estimated
          cost.</p>
