title: Humidity monitoring
page-description: "Measuring relative humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained
within a volume of air
is not fixed. As air temperature increases the air has the ability to hold more and more water vapour. As air
temperature decreases, the air's ability to hold water decreases. The effects of too high and too low humidity
can directly impact the safe running of equipment."

            <h1>Humidity monitoring</h1>
            <p>Relative humidity (RH) is a measurement of the amount of water vapour present in the air and is stated as
                a percentage of the amount needed to achieve saturation at the same temperature.</p>

        <h2>The importance of humidity monitoring</h2>
        <p>Humidity is highly sensitive to temperature and pressure fluctuations in the surrounding area and can quickly
            change.</p>
        <p>High humidity can cause an undesirable level of moisture in the air which can negatively impact a wide range
            of products as well as creating an uncomfortable environment for people. Increased moisture can damage
            electronic equipment, manufactured products, structures, encourage the growth of mould and mildew and cause
            rot.</p>
        <p>Low humidity levels can cause excess build up of static electricity, increase the susceptibility of colds and
            respiratory illnesses and allows viruses and germs to thrive. It can also have adverse effects on plants,
            wood, paint and other objects that are hygroscopic as their natural moisture levels are decreased in line
            with the RH.</p>
        <p>The aim of humidity monitoring is to ensure the safety of the local environment and allow a quick and correct
            response to the shifting factors in the surrounding area. Being able to react correctly and quickly can not
            only save products from unnecessary damage and create a safe environment for humans but it could also be
            used a cost saving initiative when it comes to air conditioning demand.</p>

        <h3>Tonal language and humidity</h3>
        <p>A humans vocal cords contain a pair of mucus membranes that stretch across the larynx. As we speak air is
            controlled from our lungs and cause the larynx to vibrate. The level of moisture in the air effects the
            elasticity of our vocal cords and hence have a direct effect on our tonal range.</p>
        <p>Recent scientific research has proven that the environment has a direct impact on speech. After studying more
            than 3,700 languages it was discovered that tonal languages found commonly in Asia rarely develop in dry
            climates.</p>

                <h3>Humidity helps bug diversity</h3>
                <p>Because most bugs are small, humidity increases the opportunity for them to survive. The smaller the
                    bug the more likely it is to dehydrate because it has a larger surface area relative to their whole
                    body size.</p>
                <p>Humid nights are especially helpful to moths who make the most of moist climates. A world leading
                    Professor of Entomology at the University of Arizona, Goggy Davidowitz, determined that hawk-moths
                    (Manduca Sexta) can detect a four percent difference in humidity by sensing changes in the
                    evaporation of flower nectar.</p>
                <p>The warm, moist atmosphere of a humid environment helps hawk- moths to identify which flowers are
                    higher in nectar than others and as a consequence helps them to conserve energy whilst foraging.</p>
