    <h2>The importance of temperature monitoring</h2>
    <p>Temperature monitoring is one of the most important and, therefore, common metrics that people wish to monitor. Incorrect temperatures can cause harm to a wide range of electrical equipment, ruin produce, encourage pathogen growth or even indicate unseen issues elsewhere.</p>
    <h3>1. Damage prevention</h3>
    <p>Ensuring that environments remain within the proper temperature range will help to extend the lifespan of equipment, produce and structures. Catching excessive or fluctuating temperatures and rectifying them before harm can be done will save replacement costs and potential impact to business down the line.</p>
    <p>Proactive action and alerting will allow for replacement plans and maintenance calls to be booked at more convenient times; further reducing negative impact on businesses.</p>

    <h2>Definition of temperature</h2>
    <p>The temperature of something is the result of the speed at which molecules move on an object. The more volatile the movement equates to a higher temperature being measured.</p>

	<p>Kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). Celsius shares the same magnitude of change as Kelvin so ±1K is equal to ±1°C.</p>
	<p>Kelvin's lowest value is 0K, absolute zero, and can go up to the theoretical limit of 10<sup>32</sup>K which is the highest temperature we believe possible according to the standard model of particle physics.</p>

	<h3>Lord Kelvin</h3>
	<p>The Kelvin temperature scale was created by a British inventor and scientist called William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). In the 1800s Lord Kelvin helped prove the theory that the volume and temperature of a gas share a relationship.</p>
	<p>Lord Kelvin patented over 70 inventions during his life-time and was instrumental in the laying of the first transatlantic telegraphcable. Because of this that he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1866. The Baron was raised to peerage in the 1890s and William Thompson was elevated to the title known as Lord Kelvin of Largs.</p>
