    <h2>Introduction to Spook smart sensors</h2>
    <p>Spook have developed smart sensors to build upon traditional sensor readings and present data in a more
      comprehensive and informative way. Smart sensors
      can be used to perform <a href="#complex-calculations">complex calculations</a> or create a <a
        href="#additional-sensor-creation">pseudo sensor</a> to add
      additional metrics not present or
      available with traditional monitoring solutions.</p>
    <p>With the use of smart sensors within OmniWatch; users are able to <a href="#combine-sensor">combine</a>, <a
        href="#compare-sensor">compare</a>
      and <a href="#group-device-monitoring">monitor devices</a> in a more
      meaningful way. Hardware and sensors are no longer treated as isolated pieces of equipment but as a part of a
      cohesive monitoring solution.</p>

        <h2>Confirm equipment activity within complex and nontraditional configurations</h2>
        <p>There are often times where multiple pieces of equipment perform the same job but don't need to be active at
          the same
          time. An example would be air conditioning (AC) units that are on duty rotation and only one or two are active
          at any
          time in order to maximise the lifetime of each system while also increasing their efficiency.</p>
        <figure class="is-text-center">
          <img alt="Confirm AC activity with smart sensor monitoring" src="/images/solutions/smart-sensor/ac-activity-confirmation.svg">
          <figcaption>Ensure at least one AC unit is operational at all times and receive an alert
            when all units are
            offline.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>With conventional monitoring, incorrect alerts would be generated whenever a unit switches from active to
          inactive, as
          each unit is treated separately with no knowledge of the others. By creating smart sensors within OmniWatch
          users area
          able to track the planned rotation cycles and be <a href="/omniwatch/alerting">alerted</a> to any unplanned
          activity which, if left unnoticed
          could cause
          unplanned service disruption.</p>

          <h3>Duty cycle types</h3>
          <ol class="is-small">
            <li>
              <strong>Load shedding</strong> - equipment is shut down for certain periods of time on a scheduled basis
              when it is considered non-essential. A variation
              of this uses demand readings from utility meters to shut down equipment when instantaneous demand reaches
              certain
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time based duty cycling</strong> - equipment is shut down periodically for fixed or variable
              intervals of time during its operating cycle. In a simple
              time-based control an example would be when the unit is not allowed to operate for a fixed interval out of
              a given
              period of time, for example 60 minutes off out of every 120 minutes on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature based duty cycling</strong> - when the controller overrides the thermostat for heating
              or cooling, so for extended periods the unit is cycled
              according to these preset on/off settings. Alternatively the equipment uses thermostats to implement the
              off-periods,
              for example, the off-period is invoked if the thermostat is satisfied during a cycle and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Price based load control</strong> - direct load is controlled where thermostat control set-points
              are offset based on pricing signals sent by the utility.
              Using this method the user can decide how much energy cost is expired at any particular time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimal start/stop</strong> - delays the equipment startup or equipment shutdown to take advantage
              of thermal lags in building structures.

        <h2>Generate an aggregate sensor from multiple devices</h2>
        <p>Within a monitoring installation not all sensors are critical, some are purely informational and although
          these typically do not have
          an alert associated with them, the data they present can be used
          meaningfully.
        <p>An example of this is power consumption of <a href="/monitoring/power/pdu">PDUs</a> which can be used to keep
          an eye on
          demand
          and costs. Smart sensors can be used to track overall power consumption or into user defined areas such as
          buildings,
          rooms, racks or departments.</p>
        <p>By combining multiple readings into a singular total OmniWatch gives its users the ability to group, compare
          and
          monitor any number of singular devices into something more meaningful while still preserving the underlying
          metrics if required.</p>

        <h2>Average a collection of sensor readings into a singular metric</h2>
        <p>
          When monitoring a number of similar sensors, knowing the average can be helpful. Smart sensors within
          OmniWatch can
          easily perform this task with any common sensors from any number of devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when monitoring the temperature within a room sensors could be located in naturally hot or cold
          locations.
          Although this may be useful when monitoring localised environmental conditions it doesn't give an overview of
          the health
          of the room as whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining and averaging sensors and creating a smart sensor this will give an actionable metric that can be
          monitored
          to prevent issues that have the potential for larger impact across a user's installation.

        <h4 class="brand-header">Delta temperature monitoring</h4>
        <h2>Keep an eye on temperature differences within racks and monitor thermal efficiency</h2>
        <p>Many organisations will use <a href="/monitoring/environmental/temperature">temperature probes</a> to monitor
          the temperatures of individual racks.
          There are several different methodologies to consider for rack based thermal management:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ASHRAE</strong> recommend at least 6 temperature probes placed at the top, middle and bottom of a
            rack both at the front and rear.</li>
          <li><strong>Gartner</strong> suggest at least 3 temperature probes. One placed at the base of the rack at the
            front to capture air intake, top of the
            front of the rack to ensure intake air reaches the equipment correctly and at the top of the rear of the
            rack to measure
            the hottest point.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimum</strong> requirements to monitor a rack effectively is one temperature probe at the bottom
            front of the rack and one at the top
            rear of the rack to capture the outtake temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a heat issue occurs it is often hidden at first by AC units compensating by extra cooling and is often
          only spotted
          when they are no longer able to keep up or fail.</p>
        <p>Creating a smart sensor to calculate the delta temperature (Î”t) within a rack can give an early warning to
          air cooling
          issues sooner than conventional monitoring. This is done by comparing the rack level air intake temperature to
          the
          outtake air temperature and configuring extra alerts to be placed when the Î”t strays outside its accepted
          limits, for
          example: Â±20Â°C.</p>

    <h2>Use existing monitored sensor readings to create new smart sensors</h2>
    <p>When monitoring a device it is sometimes beneficial to monitor conditions that aren't readily available or
      provided by
      the equipment. Creating a smart sensor to log data for a value that doesn't exist can boost insight into what is
      happening within a monitored installation. Smart sensors can be generated through combining or performing a
      calculation
      on existing sensor readings either from an individual piece of equipment or from multiple devices.</p>
    <div class="is-row">
      <div class="is-col is-40">
        <p><a href="/monitoring/power/pdu">Intelligent PDUs</a> often give you the basic 3 metrics of amps, volts and
          kWhs
          but to fully understand usage and plan new equipment deployment it is advisable to monitor stranded power.</p>
        <p>Stranded power is the amount of power a PDU is capable of delivering but is not; the higher the amount of
          stranded power the less a PDU is being utilised.</p>
        <p>When positioning new equipment it's best to use the least utilised PDU to supply power and this information
          is available instantly through OmniWatch. The impact of the additional devices can also be monitored in
          real-time to ensure that no demand spikes or irregular power consumption threaten operational uptime.</p>

        <h2>Spook's smart sensors can do complex calculations using multiple devices in many locations</h2>
        <p>When a large number of sensors and devices are monitored the collected data can often be used to increase the
          level of
          insight by performing extra calculations to compliment the raw sensor readings.</p>

        <p>A good example is when a large installation, such as a data center, monitors a variety of energy related
          products such
          as the power feed to the building, UPSs, generators, PDUs, etc. Each of these equipment types together with
          their own
          power metrics are typically monitored individually.</p>

        <h3>Power efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          However, with the same metrics it is possible to perform a calculation for the <a
            href="/monitoring/power/pue-and-dcie">
            power usage effectiveness (PUE)
            and data
            center infrastructure efficiency (DCiE)
          </a>. By tracking the PUE and DCiE of an installation in realtime, users
          are able to
          understand their current power related efficiencies. Over time, they are able to check their increased
          efficiencies and
          support this with <a href="/omniwatch/reporting">reports</a> illustrating the trend data associated with their
          efficiency gains.
        </p>

        <h3>Billing grade energy usage</h3>
        <p>
          By pairing a <a href="#combine-sensor">combined smart sensor</a> with a behind the scenes cost per kWh; users
          are able to get a cost of power usage
          within their installation. OmniWatch can also take peak and off-peak hourly charges into consideration when
          generating
          the billing cost.
