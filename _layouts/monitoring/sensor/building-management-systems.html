			<p>Spook provides instant, clear notification of TV Licensing’s BMS alerts via OmniWatch’s real-time dashboard, allowing us to rapidly investigate matters to prevent costly outages. Spook monitors our dual data centres in Darwen, Lancashire and Bristol. Our knowledge that our BMS systems are being monitored by Spook provides real peace of mind to our regional team of specialists.</p>

		<h2>What is a Building Management System (BMS)?</h2>
		<p>A Building Management System (BMS) is a centralised computer controlled monitoring system for the a building or facility.</p>
		<p>The core functions of a BMS system is typically to control and monitor utility equipment such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lighting</li>
			<li>Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)</li>
			<li>Fire alarm panels</li>
			<li>Fire hydrant systems</li>
			<li>Smoke detection</li>
			<li>ICT (Information Communications and Telecoms)</li>
			<li>Water tank monitoring</li>
			<li>Elevator operations</li>
			<li>Door entry and security systems</li>
		</ul>
		<p>BMSs vary and usually include sensors, pressure switches, flow meters, controllers, and relays.</p>

		<h2>Power monitoring</h2>
		<p>A BMS may also be used to monitor and control power distribution, energy consumption and uninterrupted power supplies (UPS) and may be referred to as building energy management systems (BEMS).</p>
		<p>A BMS helps understand how buildings are operating and enables methods of optimisation and as a consequence enrol cost efficiency processes.</p>

		<h2>Spook is an approved Endorser of the European Code of Conduct for Data Centres</h2>
		<p>The Data Centres Energy Efficiency Code of Conduct has been established in response to increasing energy consumption in data centres and the need to reduce the related environmental, economic and energy supply security impacts.</p>
		<p>The aim is to inform and stimulate data centre operators and owners to reduce energy consumption in a cost-effective manner without hampering the mission critical function of data centres.</p>
		<p>The Code of Conduct aims to achieve this by improving understanding of energy demand within the data centre, raising awareness, and recommending energy efficient best practice and targets.</p>

		<h2>Benefits of building management systems</h2>
		<p>Building management has seen an increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and green building initiatives. BMSs help building or facility managers achieve standards and provide evidential support for legislation.</p>
		<p>At the same time, IT integration and the increasing use of analytics and actionable data has led to BMSs being placed at the heart of building design strategy.</p>

		<h2>Why use OmniWatch to monitor a BMS system?</h2>
		<p>OmniWatch is not designed to replace a BMSs although OmniWatch does achieve the majority of monitoring a BMS system can do independently. In Spook’s experience organisations that have invested in BMS systems often find them to be costly and awkward to manage.</p>
		<p>OmniWatch often supplements a BMS to provide an easy to use, joined up solution for managing alerts, creating reports and providing an excellent platform to measure, analyse and control matters.</p>

		<h2>Perpetuity of data</h2>
		<p>Spook is aware collected sensor readings are a valuable asset. Spook readings are held in perpetuity. Spook understands that importance of providing longer trend data periods to study in order for a more accurate measurement to be applied.</p>
		<p>OmniWatch customers are able to accurately measure and compare readings across different time zones and periods. Trend data reports can be generated and compared for any time frame, this is ideal to ensure accurate measurement of efficiency gains or even creating seasonal or annual trend reports to identify how changes to the general climate effect monitored areas.</p>

		<h2>Auto reporting</h2>
		<p>Weekly and monthly reports are auto-generated and sent to end users via email for handy review.</p>
		<p>Anything more complicated can be created via the intuitive search engine within the on demand report function.</p>
		<p>In short Spook makes interpreting data meaningful, intuitive and incredibly easy to access.</p>
