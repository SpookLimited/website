                <h1>Wireless light meter sensor</h1>
                <p>Spook wireless light meters measure light in LUX.  LUX is a standardised measurement where 1 LUX is equal to one lumen per square metre. A lumen is calculated as a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source over a unit of time.</p>
                <p>Spook's wireless light metre measures the intensity of light from 0â€“83,000 LUX, plus recording a reading of light or no light. By default, the sensor reading is triggered on LUX.</p>
                <p>The sensor uses a highly sensitive photo-diode to detect and measure the intensity of light in an area.</p>
