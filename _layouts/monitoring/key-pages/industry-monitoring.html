        <p>Spook understands not every business has an engineer available to set up complicated systems and make sure everything is functioning correctly. That's why Spook's range of over 80 wireless sensors are perfect for monitoring across multiple industry types. Spook's wireless sensors come pre-configured and ready to go, so all that is needed is for them to be installed in the area that requires monitoring and for the sensor to be switched on.</p>
        <p>Access to Spook's cloud based remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is immediate.</p>
        <p>Although any industry can benefit from Spook's monitoring service, here are some of the key ones.</p>
