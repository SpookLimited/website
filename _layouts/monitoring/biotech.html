        <p>Spook's remote monitoring service called OmniWatch together with Spookâ€™s range of wireless sensors help organisations that are regulated by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom (UK) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America (USA) provide audible data to prove their compliance.</p>

        <h2>Controlled environmental and regulatory compliance</h2>
        <p>Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies must guarantee that their products have been maintained in strictly controlled environments. This often requires a significant expense in the implementation and overhead for advanced environmental monitoring systems.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Because Spook wireless sensor readings are held in perpetuity means users can prove, via audit trail, that they have complied in accordance with the MHRA and FDA regulations.</p>
    <p>Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have many reasons to monitor the environment. Spook has a wide variety of wireless sensors available. However, there are some common areas they share.</p>
