		<p>Any changes to OmniWatch	are recorded in the event log. Each change is clearly explained together with date and time stamps and a note of which user applied	them. By recording every change as it happens means as OmniWatch evolves with customer led amendments, they can	easily be reviewed at a later date.</p>
		<p>There is even a handy notification option to let managers know, via email, changes that are made in real-time.</p>
