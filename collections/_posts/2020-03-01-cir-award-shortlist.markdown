We are showcasing why we are witnessing a growing trend for existing customers and new prospects to move to secure Cellular Router technology for server room environmental and power monitoring. With data roaming built in for over 80 service providers including O2, Vodafone, EE and Three UK, Spook's Cellular Router solution is more resilient than most Ethernet based alternatives.

By keeping monitoring independent of an organisations network means increased security knowing sensor and data readings are being sent securely via cellular communications to Spook's AWS files servers as well as ensuring seamless monitoring even if there are localised customer network outages.
