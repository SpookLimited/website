        <h2>Ventilation and air conditioning during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</h2>
        <p>Following many months of Coronavirus upheaval, employees are returning to work in ever increasing numbers. This is also the case for schools, colleges and universities as students and staff return for their studies.</p>
        <p>Managing the CO<sub>2</sub> levels in any enclosed space has become even more important due to the pandemic and employers as well as educational management owe it to their staff and pupils to ensure efficient airflow and monitoring systems are in place to mitigate any CO2 buildup which could be detrimental to health and also <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/news/2018/dec/study-mitigating-effects-higher-co2-levels-productivity-receives-widespread-coverage">affect productivity</a>.</p>
        <p>Managing natural air flow in busy rooms is more straight forward during the warmer summer months as windows and doors can be left open. However, natural ventilation is more problematic during the winter.</p>

            </div>
            <p>If an area where people work or spend extended periods of time have neither natural or mechanical ventilation then there is a risk of contaminated air not being removed and an increase chance of exposing them to airborne pathogens.</p>

        <h3>Automated monitoring</h3>
        <p>The HSE recommends that measurements are taken at key times through the working day for at least a full day to attempt to represent CO2 levels during normal use and occupancy.</p>
        <p>With Spook's CO2 monitoring solution sensors are placed throughout the building in key areas and sensor readings are automatically collected every 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>This creates a more accurate picture of ventilation efficiency and can be left situ to capture data for rooms that have fluctuating occupancy levels.</p>
        <p>Data collected typically includes the CO2 concentration (ppm), temperature, humidity, occupancy and light level along with the time and date.</p>

        <p>Digital dashboards are designed to display all important information quickly and easily; sensors can be grouped by geographical location for instant insight into a buildings air quality or extrapolated to understand the minutiae of air quality down to room level.</p>

        <h3>Critical alerting</h2>
        <p>Sensors for CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring come in all shapes and sizes and all have differing levels of monitoring capabilities. However, Spook recommended sensors include local alerting capabilities such as traffic light systems or buzzers to inform people locally within the area if the levels get too high.</p>
        <p>Additionally Spook sensors can be updated centrally for onboard sensor management and remotely updated to reflect changes in requirements for monitoring. This is ideal for users with lots of CO<sub>2</sub> sensors and saves valuable time and resource in the event changes need to be applied.</p>
        <p>Alongside this users are easily able to set alarm trip values on sensors within OmniWatch in order to receive alerts for areas of concern by email, SMS and UK call centre.</p>

        <p>OmniWatch has been designed to store all data in perpetuity unlike conventional data loggers that overwrite old readings with new ones after a period of time.</p>
        <p>With full access to all historical data users can audit changes in air quality during different times of the year taking into account seasonal changes and during poor weather when the use of natural ventilation can be limited.</p>
        <p>Measuring sensors over a long time frame enables a more thorough understanding of indoor air quality and its associated impact to people and their welfare.</p>
