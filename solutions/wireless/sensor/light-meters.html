        <h3>AA | Industrial</h3>
        <p>Spook wireless light meters measure light in LUX. LUX is a standardised measurement where 1 LUX is equal to
          one lumen per square metre. A lumen is calculated as a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted
          by a source over a unit of time.</p>
        <p>Spook's wireless light metre measures the intensity of light from 0â€“83,000 LUX, plus recording a reading of
          light or no light. By default, the sensor reading is triggered on LUX.</p>
        <p>The sensor uses a highly sensitive photo-diode to detect and measure the intensity of light in an area.</p>

          <p>Hioki E.E. Corporation of Japan developed the first LUX meter in 1979 and went on to develop a range of
            industry leading digital light meters to measure luminance in applications for lighting installations.</p>
