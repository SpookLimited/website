				<p>Water ingress has the ability to cause damage in a matter of seconds. Whether it is water leaks from overhead pipework or leaking Air Conditioning (AC) units, all have the ability to cause substantial damage.</p>
				<p>Equally worrying is natural flood. We live in an era whereby unusual weather patterns can quickly cause flash floods. It is easy for a flash downpour to cause local flooding or entrapment of water in ducts and guttering around buildings.</p>
				<p>Spook has an array of wireless water sensors designed for detecting water ingress immediately.</p>
				<p>Spook wireless water rope sensors detect conductive liquids anywhere along the length of the detection rope by using two wires covered with conducting polymer. Place this sensor anywhere near areas susceptible to flooding or areas that have pressurised plumbing.</p>

					<li>Senses immediate presence of water anywhere along rope</li>
					<li>10 foot water rope (expandable in 10 foot sections up to 100 feet)</li>
