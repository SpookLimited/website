          Spook's wireless thermocouple sensor is available with a hardwired thermocouple or K-type connector to support
          various
          thermocouple types and ranges.
        </p>

        <p>The thermocouple measures temperatures up to 400°C (752°F).</p>

        <p>
          It is programmed to sleep for a user-given time interval (heartbeat) and then wakeup, send power to the
          thermocouple
          and
          wait for it to convert the analog data, mathematically compute the temperature and transmit the data to Spook.
        </p>

        <p>The thermocouple sensors are water resistance making measuring temperature in wet conditions practical.</p>

            Thomas Seebeck was a German scientist and invented the thermocouple in 1821, by joining two dissimilar
            metals and
            exposing them to different temperatures. The dissimilar metals produced an electric current that can be used
            to
            measure
            temperature.
          </p>

          <p>
            From 1821 to 1823, Seebeck performed a series of experiments trying to understand his contemporary Hans
            Christian
            Ørsted's findings from 1820 who had discovered electromagnetism effected the points of reference on a
            compass.
            Because Ørsted's work on electrical currents pre-dated Seebeck's findings Seebeck's results were interpreted
            as a
            thermoelectric effect. This is now called the Peltier–Seebeck effect.
