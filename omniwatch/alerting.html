        <h3>24/7 real-time monitoring and alerting</h3>
        <h1>OmniWatch's alerting service</h1>
        <p>
          When a sensor reaches its alarm condition it invokes Spook's alarm escalation procedure. Alerts are sent in
          real-time
          and have three stages. At each stage there is a time delay to allow you to acknowledge the alarm. If alarms
          aren’t
          acknowledged they pass to the next stage, eventually culminating to Spook’s UK call centre where an agent is
          tasked with
          calling you and your team on landlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should an alarm be acknowledged before passing to the next stage, the alarm escalation period is ceased and
          you and your
          team are emailed to confirm matters.

            <p>Email alerts are the first level of communication within OmniWatch. Emails are broadcast the moment an
              alert condition is discovered and logged.</p>
            <p>Emails contain all the information you need to know regarding what has caused the alarm and includes any
              linked documents such as floor-plans and trend data.</p>

            <h4>Stage 2 - SMS alerts</h4>
            <p>SMS messages are sent 10 minutes later if no-one has acknowledged the Stage 1 email. The text contains a
              brief overview of the issue.</p>
            <p>Users can confirm receipt of the alarm by replying to the SMS, this ceases the alarm escalation procedure
              and lets other team members know you are aware of the issue.</p>

              the original text. The agents are tasked with calling customer personnel in-line with the pre-agreed
              emergency rota.</p>
            <p>All call information, for example who was called and at what time they were contacted, are logged within

        <h3>Ensure the critical alerts get through with OmniWatch's escalation feature</h3>
        <p>OmniWatch has three alarm stages, each 10 minutes apart. This gives customer staff listed on the emergency
          contact rota time to logon to OmniWatch to check matters or to simply respond to the alert confirming they are
          aware of the situation.</p>
        <p>When a response is received to the alert all customer emergency contacts are emailed confirming matters and
          the alarm escalation is ceased.</p>

        <p>It's important to ensure the methods of contact for on-call staff are accurate. Fields for email, SMS and

        <p>Contacts typically vary how they are reached during business hours and out-of-office hours.</p>
        <p>Each member of the team can have multiple:</p>
        <ul>

          For organisations who operate a rota for emergency contact there is a feature within an individuals contact

        <h3>Regional and departmental workflow</h3>
        <p>Spook's customers range from single room installations to multiple locations across national and
          international borders.</p>
        <p>
          When multi-territory monitoring is required sometimes a regional manager may only need to know what is
          happening in
          their district. Whereas the global team may need an enterprise centric view across all regions and
          territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even at local level there may be a need for different departments to be responsible for their own monitoring.
          For
          example, water ingress monitoring may be the remit of the facilities department whereas the temperature of a
          room or
          cabinet may be the responsibility of another department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spook real-time dashboards provide multiple portals to cater for this, whilst ensuring management has a global
          view of
          everything.
