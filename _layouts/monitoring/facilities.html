				<h2>What is facilities monitoring?</h2>
				<p>Facilities monitoring (also known as facility monitoring or facility management) by definition is a permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary commercial or industrial property. The buildings hard facilities are typically managed by the facilities department.</p>
				<p>Facility departments are usually divided into two distinct areas, soft facility management and hard facility management. Spookâ€™s remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is used to assist the hard facility management function by monitoring disparate equipment across the enterprise.</p>

			<div class="is-col">
				<p>Typical areas of hard facilities monitoring are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Infrastructure and information communications & technology (ICT)</li>
					<li>Maintenance and warranty support</li>
					<li>Delivering new technology</li>
					<li>Ensuring business continuity</li>
					<li>Regulatory compliance</li>
					<li>Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP)</li>
					<li>Technical services</li>
					<li>Building Management Systems (BMS)</li>

				<h2>Disparate equipment monitoring</h2>
				<p>Facility departments often struggle to monitor their equipment from many different manufacturers. Even monitoring different models of the same manufacturer can be disjointed as newer versions employ different interfaces to those of their legacy counterparts. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol inclusive so is able to interpret many different protocols such as SNMP, JSON, XML, Modbus and BACnet into a single, centrally managed solution.</p>
				<p>The key to providing remote monitoring to the facility management team is making monitoring simple, intuitive and available all in one place.</p>
