    - When a power cut or interruption to the mains supply occurs it is very important to act quickly. OmniWatch sends out alerts to key members of staff at the very moment the UPS takes over feeding power giving as much warning as possible.
    - Most UPSs only have enough battery autonomy for a very short period of time and if there is no generator to take over or return of the mains supply then reducing non-critical loads quickly will help keep important equipment up and running longer.
