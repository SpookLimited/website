    - The primary reason organisations install remote monitoring is to ensure they are alerted to issues, that if went unnoticed, could cause costly service disruptions.
    - Spook's alarm procedure is perhaps the most comprehensive in the industry. OmniWatch's three-tier emergency contact process uses familiar technology to broadcast alerts via email and 2-way SMS. An extra level of protection can be assigned to critical sensors by adding Spook's UK call centre to contact users 24/7. All SMS messages and call centre contact is free of charge as part of the OmniWatch service.

    - Over time the set-up of OmniWatch will evolve and change inline with what a customer requires. As amendments are made, whether it is a contact related field, for example updating a mobile number; to changing the high trip for an alert, it is important to record what was changed, who made the change and why.
    - Every revision within OmniWatch is recorded and stored for audit purposes. Amendments can also be emailed  in real-time in order to let key personnel know without needing to logon and scrutinise log files.

    - Spook publishes installation plans for every monitored location. These clearly show where each installed sensor is along  with displaying its unique friendly name, which is referenced in any alerts, for swift fault identification.
