- problem: Failure to maintain the cold chain
  effect: Growth of bacteria on meat; the higher the temperature the faster bacteria can multiply
  outcome: A source of microbiological contamination resulting in a serious food safety hazard.

- problem: Inadequate chilling of cooked meat
  effect: Growth of bacteria on meat; the higher the temperature the faster bacteria can multiply
  outcome: Increased chance of contamination of food products by food poisoning bacteria (such as Salmonella).

- problem: Inadequate heat treatment
  effect: Failure to maintain high enough temperatures for a sufficient time
  outcome: Heat-resistant food-poisoning or spoilage organisms will not be destroyed resulting in a source of microbiological contamination.
