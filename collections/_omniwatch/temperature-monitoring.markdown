# Temperature monitoring

Measuring temperature is perhaps the most commonly monitored condition of all and as such the range of reasons to measure temperature is considerable.

From monitoring the operating temperature of server rooms housing electrical equipment and servers to refrigeration units ensuring food security and perishable food storage; the ability to measure temperature in real-time and knowing if it’s too hot, too cold or simply that there is a rapid, unexpected change all have their benefits.

## How can Spook help?

Many organisations already have various ways to measure temperature and use Spook’s remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring temperature from many different sensor manufacturers easy and intuitive.
OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> We were experiencing unusual temperature fluctuations in our server room and comms room over weekends. We compared the trend data of our temperature sensors over a 12-month period with the help of OmniWatch's on-demand reports and spotted trends over the weekends whereby our IT rooms suffered regular unplanned increases in temperature. We could create an audit report showing this trend data and share that with the Facilities team in-order to illustrate the problem and resolve matters.

## Not got temperature monitoring yet?

For organisations that have temperature monitoring requirements but haven’t yet invested in temperature sensors; Spook’s wireless temperature sensors are perfect. They are easy to install and come pre-configured so they only need to be switched on to provide immediate real-time monitoring and alerting. There are a few types of Spook wireless temperature sensors available but Spook’s wireless temperature sensor with an internal NTC thermistor is is the most popular.
