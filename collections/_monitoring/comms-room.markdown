# Spook comms room monitoring

Ensuring continued IT connectivity for a business to its users and customers.

Comms Rooms (also known as communications rooms and are usually dedicated rooms away from the server room hosting communication and network equipment.This typically includes communication hubs, routers, servers, switches, firewalls, storage devices, telephony, access control and security equipment.

Comms rooms have become increasingly important in connecting the IT needs of a business to its users and customers. As the main mechanism of connecting IT services from an organisations server room to its users throughout a building, comms rooms have become pinch points where, if not monitored, could cause loss of IT service.

Digital communications and network devices do not have as many moving parts to contend with and are therefore less susceptible to warm temperatures compared to their server room counterparts.

## Typical monitored conditions include

+ Temperature
+ Water ingress
+ Door access
+ Power

> We run our IT infrastructure spread over five buildings with multiple warehouses and bottling plants. Our server rooms and comms rooms have their own security procedures depending where they are located which means attending them throughout the day just to check things are OK is impossible. Spook OmniWatch lets us monitor the environment in each of these areas seamlessly.
