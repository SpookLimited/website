  - The activity sensor (or accelerometer) is a device used to measure different kinds of acceleration based on the rate of change of velocity. The first accelerometer, originally known as the "Atwood Machine", was invented by the English physicist George Atwood and measured linear acceleration such as a falling object. Atwood's activity sensor was initially designed to prove the principles of Sir Issac Newtons papers on universal gravity. There are many variations of accelerometers but all derive their ability to measure acceleration because of the "Atwood Machine".
