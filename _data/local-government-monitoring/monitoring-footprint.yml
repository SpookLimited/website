      - We have used Spook remote monitoring for many years. During this time we have gone out to tender at renewal time and always come back to Spook for their professional solution called OmniWatch. During the latest renewal we agreed a technical refresh to wireless sensors. Spook provided the wireless sensor hardware and ethernet gateways pre-configured and ready to install for an easy out-of-the-box upgrade.
      - Their service is excellent and we would recommend anyone looking for an easy to use yet functionally rich monitoring solution to consider OmniWatch.

      - We have used Spook to monitor our main server room in St Albans for many years. The server room is ‘lights out’ and only gets visited when work inside is required. We rely on Spook OmniWatch to remotely monitor the server rooms environment and UPS systems. OmniWatch alerts us to any changes that, if went unnoticed, could cause issues to the Councils online services. Our dealings with Spook have always been helpful and professional.

      - We have remotely monitored our main server room at the Civic Centre for many years with Spook. We added our Waterside server room at Swindon’s Waterside Park when we recently renewed the Spook service in order to extend monitoring to both locations. We know we will be contacted 24/7 for any serious issues that may occur in each of the locations which is perfect for our IT departments peace of mind.
