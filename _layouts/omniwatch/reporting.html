    <h2>On-demand reporting removes the hassle</h2>
    <p>OmniWatch's on-demand report function is an easy to use management accessory which converts the real-time collected sensor readings and equipment metrics being monitored and presents them in handy bite sized or custom designed time frames.</p>
    <p>Collected sensor readings are converted to charts showing the trend data for like-for-like readings regardless of the origin of the data. This takes the hassle out of trying to compare similar reading across disparate equipment types.</p>

  <h2>OmniWatch reporting puts all the important information in a single view</h2>
  <p>Studying the trend data within the reports can be influential in future proofing the monitored area. For example, by studying the power load of individual power strips can assist in proactive load balancing projects; or by checking the cooling efficiency of air conditioning units can help maintenance processes or provide valuable information to support equipment upgrades.</p>
  <p>Included within the report is a summary of every monitored condition with a record of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum reading</li>
    <li>Minimum reading</li>
    <li>Average reading</li>
    <li>Number of readings</li>
    <li>How many alarms have been generated per sensor</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="is-row">
    <div class="is-col">
      <h3>Alarms</h3>
      <p>All alarms are recorded within OmniWatch and each alarm can be interrogated showing each one in detail,including who were sent the alarms, which escalation stage they reached (email, SMS and Spook call centre) together with the detail of who, within the team, reacted to the alarm. Any alarms associated within the time frame of the on-demand report are filtered and published.</p>

      <h3>Change logs</h3>
      <p>It's important to keep a track on any changes to the set-up of OmniWatch. All changes are date and time stamped together with cataloging the reason for the amendment and who applied them.</p>
      <p>This is critical to understanding why changes have been applied from simply amending the high temperature trigger point of a temperature sensor to tracking a rota change or updating an email address of a key contact.</p>

      <div class="is-col is-70">
	<p>Monitoring the environment of an area is typically associated with measuring temperature, humidity and dew point although this can extend to monitoring water ingress and light levels too. The types of equipment that have sensors associated with monitoring the climate are varied. For example, temperature monitoring can be measured by climate monitors, UPS systems, intelligent power strips, refrigerators, cooling systems and more; the list is considerable. Being able to group and compare readings can be difficult but with OmniWatch on-demand reports, the ability to compare, filter and study trend data across common sensor types is simple.</p>
	<p>OmniWatch's on demand reports automatically group sensor types together for ease of use. Each sensor source can be filtered to provide a focused comparison; for example, only temperate sensors from cooling systems can be filtered as a subset of all temperature sensors.</p>

	<h2>Power monitoring reports</h2>
	<p>Power monitoring and load balancing measurements can be collected from various types of power equipment such as intelligent PDUs, power meters, UPS systems and generators. When measuring power metrics, intuitive comparisons can be made for any type of power metric but the most common are; amps, volts, kWh and stranded power.</p>
	<p>This means a true measurement of power efficiency gains can be captured across any time frame. This is extremely helpful in applying active load balancing exercises in order to prevent power loss due to a circuit breaking or due to power overload. The ability to unlock stranded power is key to maximising power usage before having to invest in expansion programs.</p>

	  <h2>Report access rights</h2>
	  <p>Spook OmniWatch filters access rights to data for on demand reports based upon a users credentials. Where multiple locations, rooms or even sensor types are monitored the ability to grade the information a user has access to is pre-configured by Spook. This means users only have access to data they are qualified to see under their remote, cloud based user accounts. On demand reports filter out any non-approved information automatically making interdepartmental, regional or confidential reports accessible only to those individuals who are qualified to see them.</p>

	  <p>OmniWatch on-demand reports can be easily customised to cover any time frame that the user requires. Unlike most other monitoring solutions OmniWatch stores all sensor data that is collected in perpetuity allowing for reports going all the way back to the installation of the software.</p>
	  <p>The report page has built-in options for:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The last 2, 7 or 30 days</li>
	    <li>Monthly reports</li>
	    <li>Week/month to date</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Users are also able to select their own time frame by selecting start and stop points in time; this is especially helpful if there is a requirement to measure multiple months/years within a singular report or narrow down the report to just a few hours.</p>

    <h2>Warranty protection</h2>
    <p>One of the most common reasons for creating an on-demand report is for auditing purposes and evidence that equipment are being operated correctly and within a manufacturers guidelines. By being able to prove this over large time frames means warranties are protected and can not be questioned if ever they are needed.</p>
    <p>Many of OmniWatch's users rely on this feature and there have been multiple occasions where this has been used to provide evidence to a manufacturer that warranties have not been voided and were able to get repairs completed or replacements for faulty equipment.</p>
