		<h2>Importance of monitoring</h2>
		<p>The key to the survival of heritage collections is to provide a stable environment for exhibits and visitors alike. Central to this is understanding the role of the building as the first line of defence against environmental instability, recognising the importance of regular environmental monitoring and control; and the division of spaces into critical areas housing collections and non-critical areas accommodating offices, cafes and communal spaces.</p>
		<p>Add into the mix that heritage organisations are now lending more of their collections and collaborating with each other means professional but discrete environmental and security monitoring is critical both in static exhibition spaces and while collections are in transit and at temporary ‘pop-up’ or ‘guest’ exhibition spaces.</p>

		<h2>Transportation and logistics</h2>
			<p>Often the preparation for pop-up or guest exhibitions begins months or even years in advance. Whether the exhibition is to be held in a counter museum on the other side of the world or in a temporary exhibition space in the UK means the logistics behind transporting fragile objects requires careful planning.</p>
			<p>Before leaving the confines of the parent organisation all objects must be assessed by conservators to see whether or not they are stable enough to travel. If objects are particularly fragile decisions need to be made on what needs to be done in order to transport them safely.</p>
			<p>Key areas for consideration are security, environmental threats and knowing exactly where consignments are in real time.</p>
			<p>Occasionally certain kinds of objects, for instance delicate ivories, artefacts, fabrics and paintings; will require special conservation materials to be included in order to maintain steady environmental conditions whilst in transit and while being displayed at the temporary location.</p>

				<h2>Wide range of artefact substances</h2>
				<p>Works of art are made from a wide range of substances and are often organic, e.g. wood, cotton, paper, bone, ivory, leather and parchment. All of these materials are hygroscopic, that is they are affected by the moisture content in the surrounding air. If the environment they are situated in is dry they will lose moisture to the atmosphere. If it is too damp they will gain moisture.</p>
				<p>This change can cause materials to swell or contract with resulting damage. In order to preserve a work of art in its original state, it should be kept in an environment that has stable, optimum humidity. This will maintain a balanced equilibrium between the exhibit and the atmosphere, preventing any moisture loss or gain and avoiding costly repairs.</p>

		<h3>Humidity and Temperature</h3>
		<p>Humidity and temperature are inextricably linked. That’s why Spook’s wireless dual humidity and temperature sensors are ideal to monitor for both in a single, unobtrusive unit.</p>
		<p>If the temperature increases in a room, the humidity level will drop if water is not artificially added. This is due to the fact that cold air holds less water than warm air. This means that dry air is largely a seasonal problem. As heating systems are turned on, indoor humidity levels drop.</p>
		<p>However, in a museum environment even minor fluctuations in humidity, such as when lights are turned on or off in a display cabinet, can cause damage over time.</p>

		<h3>Effects of low humidity</h3>
		<p>Changes in the moisture content of an exhibit may have very visible effects such as materials splitting or cracking. These effects may be microscopic to start off with but over time will become more obvious. As things become older they will become more brittle and fragile. The older they are the less able they become to re-adjust their internal moisture. Different materials are affected by moisture loss in different ways.</p>

		<h3>Humidity effects on paintings</h3>
		<p>Paintings are made up of several layers. These layers will react to moisture loss in different ways and move accordingly. This can cause them to separate resulting in blistering and flaking of the paint layer. Canvas is often considered to be less susceptible to changes in humidity, as it can adapt well to fluctuations over time. However, canvas does respond quickly to changes in humidity level so although long term differences won’t effect it drastically, rapid changes will cause constant fluctuation and may result in damage to the material or paint layer.</p>
		<p>Large panel paintings are often made up of more than one panel. If these panels move apart through warping, paint may crack or flake off. Paper and papyrus will become brittle and difficult to handle if they dry out. Although this effect is reversible by leaving them in a moist surrounding, alternate drying and damping cycles are not good for the paper structure and can cause damage.</p>
		
		<h3>Humidity effects on other materials</h3>
		<p>Ivory is also hygroscopic and behaves in a very similar fashion to wood. Thin elements of an ivory structure are extremely susceptible to changes in humidity and even a draught from a window may be enough to cause them to crack.</p>
		<p>Textiles are more likely to be damaged when handled if they are below their natural moisture level. Silk is particularly at risk as are exhibits that contain hair. Often these materials are stretched across wooden boards or frames, where the fibres can become brittle or broken if their movement is restricted.</p>
		<p>Pottery, terracotta and stone will have their internal mineral content altered in moist or dry conditions. Salts that are in the substance will rise to the surface when wet and then crystallise when dry. This can lead to stains on the surface, powdering and flaking.</p>
		<p>Mould is a threat to any hygroscopic object, if conditions are not measured mould can spread at a rapid rate to cause decay and microscopic damage.</p>
