title: Dew point monitoring
quote:
  - We have installed Computer Room Air Conditioning units to ensure air cooling redundancy and to help compensate each other when a unit becomes stressed or less efficient. We found monitoring dew point to be a helpful measurement in order to reduce ‘demand contention’. OmniWatch checks dew point as well as keeping an eye on temperature, this helps ensure our server room is energy efficient.
