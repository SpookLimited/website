That's why Spook's range of over 80 wireless sensors are perfect for monitoring across multiple industry types. Spook's wireless sensors come pre-configured and ready to go, so all that is needed is for them to be installed in the area that requires monitoring and for the sensor to be switched on.</p>
        <p>Access to Spook's cloud based remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is immediate.</p>
        <p>Although any industry can benefit from Spook's monitoring service, here are some of the key ones.</p>
