page-description: There is a wide range of Spook wireless water sensors to choose from but Spook's water rope sensor is one of the most popular. The water detection rope uses two wires covered with conducting polymer to detect the presence of water or other fluids.
did-you-know:
  - Impure water conducts electricity whilst pure water does not. Impurities in water dissolve and separate into differently charged atoms called ions. Positive ions are attracted to a negative pole whereas negative ions are attracted to a positive pole and the end result is a closed circuit.
  - Electron transference in water molecules is called the Grotthuss mechanism named after the discoverer, a German chemist called Freiherr Christian Johann Dietrich Theodor von Grotthuss (Theodor Grotthuss).
