		<p>Server rooms (sometimes referred to as a computer rooms) are usually a secure, dedicated area built within an existing office building. As a consequence, the main utilities such as power and communications are normally a subset of those available to the building as a whole. Many server rooms have been designed with power and communications redundancy in order to provide continuous IT service delivery to their business.</p>
		<h2>Spook server room monitoring</h2>
		<p>Spook's remote cloud based monitoring service, called OmniWatch, helps server room IT managers to keep an eye on the environmental and power conditions of their IT equipment. By monitoring key aspects of the climate such as temperature, humidity and water ingress also helps to protect warranties and ensure that the investment in equipment that the business has procured is maximised.</p>
		<h2>Real-time monitoring</h2>
		<p>Any interruption of the IT infrastructure in a server room could cause an organisation to suffer system downtime, loss of productivity as well as loss in revenue. OmniWatch is designed to alert users to events that, if go unnoticed, could cause business interruption.</p>
		<p>Simple actions, for example; such as opening doors and windows or installing temporary air conditioning units and fans in cases of high temperature are enough to prevent system failure and to provide valuable thinking and reaction time to remedy matters.</p>
		<p>The added benefits of monitoring presents opportunities for day to day planning. For example, measuring power metrics allows for load balancing between racks as well as temperature monitoring providing valuable information in helping to locate new servers into areas that are not heat stressed.</p>
		<h2>Lights out</h2>
		<p>Many server rooms are left unattended for the majority of time, this is known as a lights out policy. Physical visits are usually confined to when work within the server room is actually required.</p>
		<p>When you take into consideration working patterns too, it is unusual for IT staff to be present out-of-office hours including weekends. This means a server room is left unoccupied for more than 70% of the time.</p>
		<h2>Remote Working</h2>
		<p>The Covid-19 epidemic of 2020 has meant more organisations are enforcing remote working policies than ever before. IT staff are familiar with remote access to servers and networks which makes them uniquely positioned to take advantage of more stringent remote working practices. OmniWatch assists by providing IT server room remote monitoring 24/7.</p>
