# Spook comms closet monitoring

Comms closets are small rooms or even just cabinets that house critical comms equipment and sometimes servers. They often include similar equipment to that of a comms room but on a much smaller scale.Comms closets sometimes reside in corridors or in open plan offices and as such are susceptible to adding to noise and heat to areas where employees and meeting rooms reside. Because of this it is not unusual for comms closet monitoring to include sound to identify when fans and other moving parts are invoked and heat management in order not to contend with the air conditioning requirements of office users.

## Typical monitored conditions include:

+ Temperature
+ Door access
+ Power
+ Sound

> We have a main server room on the ground floor and a comms closet in the form of an IT cabinet on each of the office floors in open plan working areas. We had complaints from staff the at certain times of the day the cabinets would create noise as fans for IT kit on occasions switched on. This in turn created heat next to an adjacent meeting room. By monitoring for sound and temperature were were able to identify the offending equipment together with analysing any operating trends throughout the day. This let us install alternatives which were less distracting for staff nearby.
