Keeping an eye on server room and data centre power metrics is becoming a prerequisite as the importance of power load balancing and knowing the cost of providing power to the facility increases.

In just two decades the way servers consume power has changed beyond imagination. Back in the day variances in server power was largely due to disk drive spin-up and fans being invoked.

Today’s complex server configurations means that variances in power required for disk utilisation is reduced but more power is consumed when computational loads are enforced.
Spook’s new monitoring service is based on our flagship monitoring service called OmniWatch but has more power related functionality built in as standard.
