                <h1>Comms closet monitoring</h1>
				<p>Comms closets are small rooms or even just cabinets that house critical comms equipment and sometimes servers. They often include similar equipment to that of a comms room but on a much smaller scale. Comms closets sometimes inhabit corridors or share open plan offices and as such are susceptible to adding to noise and heat to areas where employees and meeting rooms reside. Because of this it is not unusual for comms closet monitoring to include sound to identify when fans and other moving parts are invoked and heat management in order not to contend with the air conditioning requirements of office users.</p>
				<p>Security is an issue too. Comms closets should be locked in order to prevent access to non-authorised employees or visitors.</p>
