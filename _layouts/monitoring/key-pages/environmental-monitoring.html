		<h2>Secure cloud based environmental monitoring</h2>
		<p>Monitoring the environment is important for many industries. Whether it's temperature monitoring for refrigeration units or water monitoring for leaking pipes, trapped water or even floods.</p>
		<p>Spook has developed OmniWatch to work with any hardware manufacturers equipment making monitoring the environment easy, cohesive and technically advanced.</p>
		<p>Our customers range from organisations that have already invested in environmental monitoring equipment and want a central cloud based service that is easy to use and functionally rich to businesses that are considering monitoring for the first time.</p>

				<h3>Dynamic calendaring for informed alarm escalation.</h3>
				<p>Spook's alarm escalation procedure is the most advanced in the industry. Sensors can be assigned to be critical or not. All alerts are auto-emailed and critical alerts are also sent via 2-way SMS and can be escalated to Spook's UK call-centre.</p>

				<h3>Cloud based monitoring is perfect for monitoring remotely.</h3>
				<p>All sensor data is stored securely in the cloud via Spookâ€™s dedicated AWS servers. There is no need to provide on-premise data base servers or subscribe to software licences. This ensures all monitoring is safe, secure and automatically backed up. Cloud based monitoring is perfect for monitoring remotely.</p>

				<h3>Support legacy and new hardware; irregardless of manufacturer.</h3>
				<p>The benefits of monitoring the environment centrally across an array of different equipment manufacturers is easy to illustrate. Organisations often have different types of hardware installed as new makes and models become available. Older, legacy monitoring devices can be managed in a similar way to new ones and be given a new lease of life thus ensuring the initial investment in hardware and sensors is maximised.</p>

				<h3>All data is stored forever; perfect for trend analysis.</h3>
				<p>Spook recognises that sensor readings and their associated trend data is a valuable management commodity. By storing the readings perpetually means measuring efficiency gains is accurate as measurements can be plotted for long time periods. Identifying patterns in the trends of sensor readings together with understanding their regularity can prove useful in building preventative measures for environmental protection.</p>

				<h3>Ideal for audits and investigations.</h3>
				<p>Reports can be created showing all monitored activity, sensor readings, trend data, user changes, alarm histories and installation plans. The on demand report function is ideal for audits and investigations on how alerts were managed by users and understanding how an alarm for a particular sensor impacted the environment and any other associated sensors.</p>
				<p>Quick reports can be created for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Week</li>
					<li>Month</li>
					<li>Week to date</li>
					<li>Month to date</li>
					<li>Last 2, 7 and 30 day periods.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A custom start and end date can also be applied for reports that are required for longer periods.</p>
