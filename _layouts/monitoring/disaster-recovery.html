                <p>Disaster recovery is a subset of business continuity planning (BCP) and focuses on policies, tools and procedures used to get critical business functions operational again after a disaster.</p>

                <h2>Prevention is better than cure</h2>
                <p>Spook's ethos of <strong>prevention is better than cure</strong> is as important today as it was when the Spook was established in 2003. As specialists in environmental and power monitoring OmniWatch is chiefly deployed in data centres and IT server rooms.</p>
                <p>It is generally well known that the majority of business disruption is caused by unplanned IT downtime. By monitoring the key environmental and power elements of IT rooms, if there is an alarm, remedial action can take place to normalise matters in order to maximise business uptime.</p>
                <p>Over half of OmniWatch's alarms prove critical, this means users are alerted to issues that could effect their IT uptime at the earliest opportunity. They can take remedial action to stabilise matters before having to invoke their disaster recovery plans.</p>
                <p>By knowing there is an issue in the early stages gives valuable thinking and reaction time to busy IT staff. For instance sometimes even the simplest actions like opening doors and windows or installing temporary fans if air conditioning fails and temperatures rise can be enough to get things under control and address the problem.</p>

                <h2>Avoid potential financial loss from unplanned downtime</h2>
                <p>According to various reports and studies up to 80% of data centres do not have adequate or in some cases any back-up power generation facility. Therefore the potential financial cost of such disruption is significant.</p>
                <p>A <a href="http://img2.insight.com/graphics/uk/shop/ca/ca-acd-report.pdf">CA Technologies study</a> found that €17 billion in revenue is being lost in each year in the time taken to recover from unplanned IT downtime. The study also comments that post-downtime there is an additional delay during which time data is still being recovered and that during the post-outage period, company revenue generation is still severely hampered, down by an average of 25%.</p>

                    <p>We were alerted to a water leak from a kitchen adjacent to our server room over the weekend. When we arrived on-site the main cold water pipe had burst and was spreading pressurised water from the kitchen to the server room under the false floor. We were able to deal with the problem immediately rather than waiting to face the issue during the working week. We managed to stop the mains incoming water supply and dry out the area over the weekend which minimised disruption for workers as they arrived on Monday morning. We are certain this stopped us needing to invoke our DR procedure.</p>
