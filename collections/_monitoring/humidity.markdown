did-you-know:
  - Leonardo da Vinci created the first crude hygrometer in the 1400s but Horace Bénédict de Saussure invented the first human hair humidity hygrometer in 1783. However, the invention of the humidity measuring instrument caused controversy as Jean-André Deluc had invented a whalebone version in the same year.
