page-description: Spook wireless 3 phase AC meters use current transformers (CT) to measure the RMS (root, mean, square). The CT is installed around the live wire (also known as the hot wire) of equipment in order to measure the AC power in real-time.
did-you-know:
  - The current transformer is thought to have been invented by the Hungarian electrical engineer Ottó Titusz Bláthy. Ottó was a prolific inventor and during his career, he became the co-inventor of the modern electric transformer, the AC Watt-Hour meter which was patented by him in the autumn of 1889, the tension regulator, the motor capacitor and the turbo generator.  
  - The name "transformer" was thought to be created by Ottó and in 1885 the ZBD model alternating-current transformer was invented by him and two other Hungarian engineers Miksa Déri and Károly Zipernowsky. (ZBD comes from the initials of their names). In the autumn of 1889 he patented the AC watt-meter.
