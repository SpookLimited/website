- name: Temperature
  tagline: Thermal condition monitoring.

  description:
    - Temperature monitoring is a critical condition to monitor for climate control and is perhaps the most commonly measured condition of all environmental states.
    - Whether you need to know if it's too hot, too cold or simply that there is a rapid change; measuring thermal activity is key to climate monitoring.

- name: Humidity
  tagline: Atmospheric moisture control.
  link: /monitoring/environmental/humidity
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/humidity.svg
  description:
    - Measuring relative humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained within a volume of air is not fixed. As air temperature increases it has the ability to hold more water vapour.
    - High or low humidity can directly impact the safe running of electrical equipment.

- name: Dew point
  tagline: Water droplet condensation.
  link: /monitoring/environmental/dewpoint
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/dewpoint.svg
  description:
    - Dew point is a calculation between temperature and relative humidity. Dew point is the point at which water vapour in the air starts condensing.
    -  Dew point is always expressed as a unit of temperature (Â°C).

- name: Airflow
  tagline: Measuring the movement of air.

  description:
    - Airflow is important to ensure ducts and airways are free from blockage. However, since the Covid-19 epidemic of 2020 airflow monitoring is fast becoming a necessity.
    - According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation.

- name: Water ingress
  tagline: Water and moisture monitoring.
  link: /monitoring/environmental/water
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/water.svg
  description:
    - Monitoring water ingress is usually critical as water has the power to cause immediate disruption. Water has the potential to do the most damage in the shortest amount of time.
    - Whether there is a burst water pipe, build up of storm water or a boiler leak; knowing there is water ingress gives valuable early warning time to remedy matters before it becomes a deluge.

- name: Light 
  tagline: Measuring LUX (luminescence/unit area).
  link: /monitoring/environmental/light
  icon: /images/sensor/icons/light.svg
  description:
    - Monitoring light has many applications, from knowing whether lights are on or off for safety reasons to more security based applications such as monitoring light in parking lots, garages and common areas of use in commercial buildings.
    - Measuring light is also important to offices and office workers. Regulation no.8 of the Workplace Regulations Act 1992 gives guidance to what is needed.
