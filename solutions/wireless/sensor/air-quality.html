          PM stands for Particulate Matter (PM) and Spook's wireless meter is designed for measuring IAQ (Indoor Air
          Quality) and
          contains a small fan that harvests an ambient air sample. The particles are scattered and measured with a
          laser to
          determine which of the three monitored levels they fall within; PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and
          PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations in the air.
          PM1 are the most dangerous of all and can easily enter the lungs and penetrate organs.
        </p>

        <p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> are 25% bigger and represent particles that can easily be inhaled and can penetrate deep
          into the lungs.</p>

        <p>
          PM<sub>10</sub> are particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less and particles of this size irritate
          the respiratory tract
          and eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          To put this in perspective, the average human hair is 70 micrometers in diameter making it about 30 times
          larger than
          PM<sub>10</sub>.

            Particle pollution is the term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air.
            Some
            particles can be seen with the naked eye such as dust, or smoke. However, others are so small they can only
            be detected
            using an electron microscope.
          </p>

          <p>
            IAQ is known to affect the health, comfort, and well-being of building occupants so employees, visitors and
            workers
            alike are all exposed to the effects of poor IAQ and can be linked sick building syndrome, reduced
            productivity, and
            impaired learning in schools.
          </p>

          <p>
            IAQ can be affected by gases such as carbon monoxide and radon and organic microbial contaminants such as
            mould or
            bacteria.
