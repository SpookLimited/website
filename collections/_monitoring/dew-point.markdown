did-you-know:
  - Leonardo da Vinci created a hygrometer in the 1400s but it was crude and fairly inaccurate. It was Horace Bénédict de Saussure who accurately created a humidity sensor using human hair to measure wetness in the air in 1783. As the hair became wet it expanded and as it dried it contracted. However it was John Frederic Daniell, a British chemist and meteorologist who invented the dew point hygrometer in 1820.
