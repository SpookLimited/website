      - Boilers must maintain a certain temperature level for safe, reliable and effective operations. A boiler room is a place usually where no one goes until there is a problem. However most of the time no one knows there is a problem with the heating system until it is too late. To help prevent such issues, remote monitoring can be hugely beneficial.

      - Schools, Colleges and Universities are very expensive properties to build and maintain, presenting a unique challenge when they go unoccupied during the week or over the summer. While there might be a handful of staff members present year-round, it is difficult for these individuals to keep an eye on the entire property. Even during term-time knowing the establishment is protected is extremely challenging.

      - Many buildings have extensive plumbing with pressurised water being processed around the facility. Knowing if there is a burst water pipe or leaking boiler is often difficult and usually only noticed when there is a deluge and considerable damage. Temperature is also a key factor to ensure pipework and water tanks are not frozen during winter months. This is particularly challenging for older grade listed or heritage buildings whose plumbing can be many decades old.
