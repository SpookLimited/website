                <h1>Wireless dew point sensor</h1>
				<p>Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated at 100 percent relative humidity. It is a calculation derived from relative humidity and temperature. If the dew point is below 0°C (32°F) its water vapour will become ice which point the the dew point is termed the frost point.</p>
				<p>Spook calculates dew point by installing a dual temperature and humidity (RH) sensor, the dew point is automatically calculated and expressed as °C. Try Spook's free dew point calculator here.</p>
				<p>The dual sensor monitors the values in a single casing and is made to a high scientific grade. It has a relative humidity accuracy of ± 3% (between 10%-90% RH) and a temperature accuracy of ± 1°C (1.8°F).</p>
