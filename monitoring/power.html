        <h2>Secure cloud based power monitoring</h2>
        <p>By monitoring power consumption an organisation can implement informed load balancing procedures to prevent
          power
          overloads and protect service outages due to loss off power.</p>
        <p>It is also useful to understand the cost associated with providing power to a business as a whole or to
          departments or
          even end users.</p>
        <p>When monitoring high numbers of PDUs (Power Distribution Units) itâ€™s important to be able to swiftly identify
          individual
          or clusters of power strips. With OmniWatch this is achieved by a global search function. Regional or
          departmental
          identification can be overlaid with localised search options too.</p>
        <p>In short Spook makes interpreting bulk data meaningful, intuitive and incredibly easy.</p>

        <p>Accurate alarm procedures are key to minimising potential disruption when something goes wrong. An

        <p>User defined alarms are handled by automatic e-mail and 2-way SMS. These can be escalated to Spook's UK Call

        <h2>Bulk data collection and seamless power management with support for all modern protocols.</h2>
        <p>The benefits of monitoring power metrics centrally across an array of different equipment manufacturers is
          easy
          to illustrate. Change management procedures can be broadcast swiftly over multiple protocols and older, legacy
          power power strips, can be given a new lease of life thus ensuring the initial investment in hardware is
          maximised.</p>
        <p>Without central management even the smallest of reconfigurations such as amending the on-board emergency
          contact
          procedures can take hours. OmniWatch provides real-time secure cloud based dashboards in order to manage
          hundreds
          of devices easily and intuitively.</p>
        <p>The key to providing seamless bulk power monitoring is to make monitoring simple and available all in one
          place
          irrespective of the many different equipment manufacturers, models or equipment types.</p>
        <p>That's why Spook's OmniWatch is designed to collect data across the facility using multiple protocols such as
          SNMP, Modbus, BACnet, XML and JSON.</p>

        <h2>Perpetual data storage for trend analysis, load balance planning and efficiency impact tracking</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="is-col is-80">
        <p>Spook recognises that power readings and their associated trend data is a valuable management commodity. By
          storing the power consumption data perpetually means measuring efficiency gains, load-balancing and long-term
          trend analysis is accurate. Not only can patterns in power spikes be identified together with their regularity
          but
          identification of spare power known as stranded power is simple.</p>
        <p>The amount of stranded power obviously varies per PDU and may only be a small amount but when extrapolated
          across
          hundreds of power strips this figure can be considerable. By tapping into this valuable resource means an
          organisation can confidently maximise power consumption at rack level before having to invest in additional
          data
          centre expansion.</p>
        <p>However it is important to understand the stressed power requirement of a power strip; this being the total
          power
          requirement when all attached equipment is set to maximum consumption, before utilising stranded power.</p>
