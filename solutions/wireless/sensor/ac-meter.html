        <h1>Wireless alternating current (AC) sensor</h1>
        <h3>AA | Industrial</h3>
        <p>Spook wireless AC meters use current transformers (CT) to measure the RMS (root, mean, square). The CT is
          installed around the live wire (also known as the hot wire) of equipment in order to measure the AC power in
          real-time.</p>
        <p>Available metrics for RMS are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Amp hours (which can be converted to watt hours or kilowatt hours).</li>
          <li>Average current</li>
          <li>Maximum current</li>
          <li>Minimum current</li>
        </ul>

          <p>An early form of alternating current electrical generator was built in 1832 by a French instrument maker
            called Hippolyte Pixii. Based in Paris, France; Pixii did not fully understand electromagnetic induction,
            however his alternating current electrical generator was the blue print for many more devices, each gaining
            more sophistication as they learned from the predecessors.</p>

          <p>Alternating current changes polarity or direction over time hence its name but it is considered more
            dangerous than direct current. However, alternating current is much more efficient and makes the
            transmission of electrical power over great distances very economical.</p>
