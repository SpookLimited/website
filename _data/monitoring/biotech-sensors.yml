- name: Temperature

  link: /monitoring/sensor/temperature/
  words:
      - Spook's wireless temperature sensors monitors sensitive areas whereby without warning there is a problem, will cause non-compliance issues. Therefore by receiving early warnings of changes in temperature gives valuable time to check or remedy the situation.
      - Temperature creep is also important to know. As time goes by fridges and freezers can become less efficient, by spotting the inefficiency before it becomes a problem means preventative maintenance programs can be easily implemented.

- name: Mains power

  link: /monitoring/sensor/ac-meter/
  words:
      - Many medicines need to be refrigerated and loss of power can be catastrophic. Causes of loss of power are typically broken circuit breakers, blown fuses, wiring issues, or faulty storage room control boards.
      - Spook's wireless AC (Alternating Current) meters measure power consumption and this is a clear indicator to ensure everything is working fine. If the motor of the refrigeration unit is constantly running, this could indicate a refrigerant leak or another leak elsewhere that is allowing cold air to escape.

- name: Water ingress
  image: /images/sensor/water-probe.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/water/
  words:
      - Spook wireless water sensors check there is no leaking water or ice buildup in refrigerators. Water ingress alerts indicate underlying problems with the coolant inlet which will require professional maintenance to fix. Medicines should be destroyed if water contamination occurs.

- name: Security

  link: /monitoring/sensor/motion/
  words:
      - Spook wireless activity detection sensors are ideal to detect movement. Once an established a pattern of behaviour is identified, it is easy to be alerted if unexpected movement is detected. By monitoring when areas are entered helps prove that compliance is met.

- name: Boundary/pressure pad
  image: /images/sensor/boundary.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/boundary-and-ir/
  words:
      - These sensors are ideal for areas that need to allow activity in an area but ensure security is adhered to in difficult to control areas such as open racking for medicine and chemistry components. Often these areas need protecting to ensure no one intrudes beyond the permitted area.
      - By installing Spook wireless open/closed sensors to IR beams and pressure pads, any vulnerable area can be monitored with ease.

- name: Open/closed status
  image: /images/sensor/openclosed.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/openclosed
  words:
      - Spook wireless open/closed sensors provide information on the status of doors, windows and cabinets. Knowing if doors or windows are open is an important feature. Cabinets and rooms that contain secure items may also need to be monitored.
      - Spook wireless sensors for remote monitoring helping maintain the cold chain for constant refrigeration.
      - Refrigerators and freezers are essential for certain businesses in order to remain functioning. In the case of an outage, there is a lot of time and money spent trying to get operations back on track.
      - Spook's OmniWatch remote monitoring service together with Spook's wireless sensor range is designed to give early advanced warning of changes in the environment to give valuable thinking and reaction time to save the contents of faulty fridges and freezers.
      - Refrigerators and freezers usually have many thousands of pounds worth of food supplies in them which need to be kept at a specific temperature to avoid spoilage. Walk-in coolers are accessed frequently throughout the day, but are rarely monitored after a restaurant or business closes for the evening. This period of time is where the most damage occurs as perishables can be left in an ever increasing temperature, often too late to save the next morning.
      - While repairs can be costly for these machines, the real expense of rising temperatures is the irreplaceable damage done to product inside.
      - Equally important is storing the goods in known food hygiene limits to ensure safety in public consumption. OmniWatch is designed to alert customers to sudden changes that may impact the uptime of their refrigeration units and as a consequence protect refrigerated or frozen produce. Some of the more common issues seen with coolers or freezers can all be monitored by OmniWatch.

- name: Chiller humidity and temperature
  image: /images/sensor/humidity.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/humidity/
  words:
      - Spook wireless humidity sensors monitor temperature and humidity within a single sensor enclosure. These monitor the efficiency of chillers as it is easy for them to be affected by incorrect temperature settings and tolerances.
      - High humidity or temperature within a chiller, or during the thawing process, will allow surface growth of mould and food degradation. These need to be kept as low as possible.

- name: Air flow
  image: /images/sensor/airflow.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/airflow/
  words:
      - Spook wireless airflow sensors are ideal to monitor the air speed and airflow of refrigerating units. Ensuring chilled air is equally distributed in a large unit filled with produce is key to food security and ensuring the longevity of perishable goods.

- name: Open/closed status
  image: /images/sensor/openclosed.svg
  link: /monitoring/sensor/openclosed/
  words:
      - Spook wireless open/closed sensors provide information on the status of doors. Monitoring the opening and closing of chiller doors to ensure activity is kept to a minimum is key to ensure proper temperatures are maintained.
