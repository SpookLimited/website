title: PUE and DCiE monitoring
page-description: "Total electrical power consumed by IT equipment in data centres has been relatively stable
historically, but new designs for server processors include energy management capabilities that can result in
substantial power consumption fluctuations. This can present potentially numerous problems, including overheating,
overloading a circuit breaker and loss of redundancy."

    <h2>What is PUE and DCiE?</h2>
    <p>
      PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and DCiE (Data Centre infrastructure Effectiveness) are industry standard
      efficiency
      benchmarks comparing the overall energy used for a data centers infrastructure versus its energy used for its
      existing
      IT load.
    </p>

    <p>
      By measuring PUE and DCiE presents an efficiency score and sets a testing framework for the data center to repeat
      and
      compare. By continually comparing scores, data center managers can verify the impact of what should be the focus
      of
      their ongoing efficiency efforts in order to gain greater cost savings and efficiencies in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      At any given time, they are comparing the power currently used for the IT equipment needs with the power used by
      the
      infrastructure as a whole which keeps that IT equipment cooled, powered, backed-up and protected.

        <h2>The benefits of PUE and DCiE monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          Knowing what the efficiency figures are in real-time is allows users to highlight areas for improvement in
          order to to
          achieve better ratings over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The objective is to ensure that the maximum possible percentage of power utilised in a data center is actually
          used by
          IT equipment and the minimum by supporting equipment such as AC units and other peripheral equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding PUE and DCiE is only the beginning. Efficiency gains should be regularly calculated, preferably
          in real
          time. By doing this users can check how well they are doing on different days of the week, month and year.
          This is
          particularly important as it identifies equipment overheads that may be missed if the measurements are made
          infrequently.
        </p>

    </div>
    <h2>Perpetuity of data</h2>
    <p>
      Spook retains all PUE and DCiE readings in perpetuity so users can study trends for efficiency more accurately.
      The
      results can easily be exported in OmniWatch on-demand reports.

      <h2>Computational loads</h2>
      <p>Typically servers operate at light computational loads, with actual power draw amounting to less than the
        server's potential maximum power draw capabilities.</p>
      <p>However, because many IT personnel can be unaware of this discrepancy, it's easy to plug more servers than are
        necessary into a single power circuit.</p>
      <p>This in turn creates the potential for possible circuit overloads, as the circuit rating can be exceeded by the
        total maximum server power consumption.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="circuit-overload">
      <h2>Circuit overloading</h2>
      <p>Another complication is that when servers are simultaneously subjected to heavy loads, circuit overloads will
        occur. When circuits are overloaded, the entire circuit can be tripped and power shut off to IT equipment.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since this happens as a result of heavy loads, power outages at this time can have significant
        negative effects on business.</p>

          manner without impacting the mission critical function of data center facility.
          The Code of Conduct aims to achieve this by improving the understanding of energy demand within the data
