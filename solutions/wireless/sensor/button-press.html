            In 1916 educator and activist Dorothy Canfield Fisher lamented the fact that so often in modern America 'one
            may press a
            button and be served'. She went on to explain the responsibilities 'behind the button'. She warned that the
            electric
            button would cause the wheels of initiative to be broken, or at least become rusty from long disuse. She
            cautioned that
            'button pressers' did not understand the mechanical processes that happened behind the scenes and therefore
            they would
            lose all ability to navigate in the world.
