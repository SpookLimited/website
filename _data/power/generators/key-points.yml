- name: Improve generator performance
  icon: /images/icons/performance.svg
  color: green
  description:
    - Monitor key generator performance metrics like - total energy produced, exact fuel consumption, the energy produced per litre of fuel (kWh/litre ratio), power quality and RMS parameters.

- name: Prevent fuel theft

  color: red
  description:
    - Generators are usually installed in remote locations due to their decibel (Db) rating whilst in use. Theft from generator reservoirs is increasing due to the high cost of fuel. Instantly detect if fuel is being stolen by monitoring realtime fuel levels in generator reservoirs.
    - Also, it is important to monitor and make sure that accurate fuel amounts are delivered to generators, this is especially important in times of continuous use.

- name: Reduce maintenance costs

  description:
    - Realtime monitoring to check a generator's status, repairs to used parts, maintenance slots and refuelling schedules means you can reduce the need for costly service calls. This means staff do not need to waste valuable time in unnecessary site visits by the maintenance service providers.

- name: Calculate efficiency
  icon: /images/icons/efficiency.svg
  color: green
  description:
    - The efficiency of a diesel engine is calculated based on total energy produced, fuel consumed, and other parameters like temperature, oil pressure, etc. By monitoring these and perhaps introducing Spook smart sensors to help calculate additional metrics, efficiencies can be easily identified.

  color: green
  description:
    - Create power generation reports for any time frame. Key generator trend data is stored in perpetuity within OmniWatch making creating reports a cinch.

- name: Run time remaining
  icon: /images/icons/time-remaining.svg
  color: green
  description:
    - Automatically calculate run time remaining automatically and receive realtime alerts when fuel reservoirs are depleting to dangerous levels.
