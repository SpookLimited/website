# Light Monitoring
Measuring light has become a common practice in many industries, from making sure employee's are operating in safe working conditions to growing plants in greenhouses.

Light monitoring is becoming more common in precision agriculture too. By understanding the measurement of light crops can maximise growing conditions.

### Examples of light levels:

Very bright summer day : 100,000 Lux

Full daylight : 10,000 Lux

Overcast summer day : 1,000 Lux

Very dark day : 100 Lux

Twilight : 10 Lux

Full Moon : <1 Lux

## How can Spook help?

Many organisations already have various ways to measure light and use Spook's remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring light from many different sensor types easy and intuitive.

OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> We have an unusual campus in Guernsey. Our main shop is at North Quay in St Sampson harbour and our data centres are adjacent. We also have a church hall housing some critical equipment approximately half a mile away. Quite often workmen enter the off-site building and forget to secure it afterwards, often leaving lights on and doors unlocked. Knowing if there is light in the church hall is a good indication someone has forgotten to lock up or if sudden light occurs, this could easily be intruders. Spook monitors the light level for us so we can be made aware and attend site when necessary.
