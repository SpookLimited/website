title: Humidity monitoring
words:
  - Measuring relative humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained within a volume of air is not fixed. As air temperature increases the air has the ability to hold more and more water vapour.
  - As air temperature decreases, the air's ability to hold water decreases. The effects of too high and too low humidity can directly impact the safe running of equipment.
quote:
  - Our Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units have automatic de-humidification functions. When the humidity becomes too high or too low our CRAC units compensate their settings to adjust the humidity automatically. OmniWatch helps us to ensure humidity levels remain within their expected levels.
