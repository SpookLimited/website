      - Temperature monitoring is an important measurement for climate control and is perhaps the most commonly measured condition of all environmental states.
      - Whether you need to know if it's too hot, too cold or simply that there is a rapid change; measuring the activity of temperature is key to climate monitoring.

  words:
      - Measuring relative humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained within a volume of air is not fixed. As air temperature increases the air has the ability to hold more and more water vapour.
      - As air temperature decreases, the air's ability to hold water decreases. The effects of too high and too low humidity can directly impact the safe running of equipment.

  words:
      - Dew point is inextricably linked between temperature and relative humidity. Dew point is the temperature at which water vapour in the air starts condensing.
      - Environments with high relative humidity (RH) and rapid changes in temperature are most likely to experience condensing humidity. Dew point is always expressed as a temperature (Â°C). Try Spook's free dew point calculator <a href='#'>here</a>.

  words:
      - Airflow monitoring has always been important to ensure ducts and airways are free from blockage. However, since the Covid-19 epidemic of 2020 airflow monitoring is fast becoming a necessity.
      - According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation.

  words:
      - Monitoring water ingress is one of the most important conditions to monitor as water has the power to cause immediate disruption. Water has the potential to do the most damage in the shortest amount of time.
      - Whether there is a burst water pipe, build up of storm water or a boiler leak; knowing there is water ingress gives valuable early warning time to remedy matters before it becomes a deluge.

  words:
      - Monitoring light has many applications, from knowing whether lights are on or off for safety reasons to more security based applications such as monitoring light in parking lots, garages and common areas of use in commercial buildings, they all benefit from monitoring light.
      - Measuring light is also importation to agricultural businesses such as greenhouse and crop management, understanding LUX (luminescence/unit area) can assist maximising growing conditions of plants and vegetation.
