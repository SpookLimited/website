<p>Pure water does not conduct electricity because because of its lack of free electrons and therefore it does not contain ions (Ions are formed when atoms lose or gain electrons). For water conductivity to be viable the water needs to contain ions.</p>
<p>Stephen Gray an English astronomer and dyer studied electrical conduction and was the first person to discover that electricity can flow through wires. Up until his work, published in 1729, all other studies into electricity focussed on the generation of static electrical charges. Thanks to his contribution the study of how water conducts electricity could be made. However, it's taken nearly two hundred years for scientists to witness exactly how this happens.</p>
<p>As impure water has positive and negative ions contained within it in, positive ions are attracted to a negative pole and vice versa. As the ions are attracted to each pole a short circuit is induced and this is a fundamental process for developing water detection sensors.</p>
