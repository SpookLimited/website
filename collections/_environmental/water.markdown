title: Water ingress monitoring
quote:
  - We have noticed we are at the mercy of unusual weather patterns. Over recent years it is not unusual for the town to suffer deluges from periods of heavy rain. We have a series on IT rooms within the town hall that unfortunately have ducts and a specific area on the campus near to one of our data centres that does flood.
  - We have installed water sensors in each of these areas in order to keep an eye on matters as well as monitoring the key areas in the various data centres and server rooms. OmniWatch reliably alerts us when these awkward non IT areas are nearing a level that may cause us problems.
