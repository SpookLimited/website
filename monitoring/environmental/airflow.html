      <h2>The importance of airflow monitoring</h2>
      <p>Airflow management is a crucial tool because it can remove the chance of excess static electricity and dust building up that can cause damage to equipment. The sooner ventilation failures are detected, the faster preventative and remedial measures can be managed.</p>
      <p>There are many reasons airflow may become less efficient however the most common reasons are associated with:
      <ul>
        <li>Missed filter changes</li>
        <li>Motors of HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) becoming less efficient or failing</li>
        <li>Fans become unbalanced and out of sequence</li>
        <li>Obstructions being placed in air flow channels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Larger rooms often require additional sensor information to determine potential problems with cooling efficiency. It's therefore very important to measure the rate of airflow throughout to gauge the overall health of the environment.</p>

          <p>Our server rooms are spread across London with the main IT rooms being in Hammersmith and our fail-over room is in Canary Wharf. We had a problem with unusual high temperatures in the Canary Wharf location and after some lengthy investigation we realised the air conditioning (AC) filters had become blocked.</p>
          <p>Although the AC units were working they had become considerably less efficient. By installing air-flow sensors near to the air conditioning outlets we now monitor the strength of airflow as a key element of our preventative maintenance program.</p>

          <h2>Fun fact</h2>
          <h3>Cat whiskers use airflow</h3>
          <p>It's hard to believe a cat uses whiskers to measure airflow but it's true. The official name for cats whiskers is vibrissae, which comes from Latin <i>vibrio</i> and means "to vibrate".</p>
          <p>Cats whiskers are not limited to just around their nose, they're also above their ears, eyes, jaw and forelegs. The whiskers on their forelegs are called carpal whiskers and they help to determine movement of prey. However, cats have an even number of whiskers on their muzzle, each having twelve whiskers on each side which are completely symmetrical. The symmetrical pattern means they can accurately measure the environment.</p>
          <p>A cats whisker has hair follicles with hundreds of nerves and the tip of the whisker has a proprioceptor; which is a separate sensory organ. Together, this makes whiskers highly sensitive to airflow and changes in their environment.</p>
