		<h2>Custom contact rota</h2>
		<p>All alerts can be designed to vary how emergency client personnel are contacted throughout the day (e.g. specific staff in office hours and separate emergency personnel for all other times).</p>

		<h5>Stage two</h5>
		<h2>SMS alerts</h2>
		<p>For critical alerts that require confirmation the system can send SMS alerts to your phone. SMSs contain key information about the current alarm as well as the ability to reply to confirm the alarm; no internet connection required.</p>
