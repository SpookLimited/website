        <h2>Secure cloud based climate monitoring</h2>
        <p>Spook's secure remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is designed to work with most climate measuring
          hardware and sensors making monitoring the environment easy, cohesive and technically advanced.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch's main function is to alert users to changes to the sensors being monitored via email, SMS and UK
          call centre. In addition, Spook understands that users real-time dashboards must be intuitive yet functionally
          rich. That's why OmniWatch's functionality has been and continues to be designed by customer led feedback.</p>
        <p>Spook's customers range from organisations that have already invested in climate monitoring equipment and
          want a central cloud based service that is easy to use and functionally advanced to businesses that are
          considering monitoring for the first time and want a hassle free, out-of-box monitoring solution.</p>

        <p>Temperature monitoring is an important measurement for climate control and is perhaps the most commonly
          measured condition of all environmental states.</p>

        <p>Whether you need to know if it's too hot, too cold or simply that there is a rapid change; measuring the
          activity of temperature is key to climate monitoring.</p>

        <p>Measuring relative humidity (RH) is important because the amount of water that can be contained within a
          volume of air is not fixed. As air temperature increases the air has the ability to hold more and more water
          vapour.</p>

        <p>As air temperature decreases, the air's ability to hold water decreases. The effects of too high and too low
          humidity can directly impact the safe running of equipment.</p>

        <p>Dew point is inextricably linked between temperature and relative humidity. Dew point is the temperature at
          which water vapour in the air starts condensing.</p>

        <p>Environments with high relative humidity (RH) and rapid changes in temperature are most likely to experience
          condensing humidity. Dew point is always expressed as a temperature (Â°C). Try Spook's free dew point

        <p>Airflow monitoring has always been important to ensure ducts and airways are free from blockage. However,
          since the Covid-19 epidemic of 2020 airflow monitoring is fast becoming a necessity.</p>

        <p>According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in
          the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation.</p>

        <p>Monitoring water ingress is one of the most important conditions to monitor as water has the power to cause

        <p>Whether there is a burst water pipe, build up of storm water or a boiler leak; knowing there is water ingress
          gives valuable early warning time to remedy matters before it becomes a deluge.</p>
