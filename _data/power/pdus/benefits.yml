    - Today's processing techniques means that equipment has additional power management capabilities like moving virtual loads, auto changing clock frequencies and adjusting voltage magnitudes.
    - So while the power variation impact was in the low percentiles two decades ago, today's servers can vary with easily up to 50% to 100% as on-demand power increases. This can result in numerous issues, including overheating, branch circuit overload and loss of redundancy.

    - By measuring the power consumption over time the trend data becomes a valuable commodity. Not only can any patterns in power spikes be identified but identification of how high they reach when servers are at maximum stress levels can prove invaluable for building in power related latency.
    - Ensuring efficient load balancing reduces these stresses and helps preventative maintenance projects to be achievable.

    - Equally important is knowing the power draw of your equipment in a non-stressed state. 
    - For example if you know you have 5 servers drawing 2.5 amps each from a single power strip you can conclude if there is a drop of more than 2.5 amps on global power consumption means it is likely a server has suffered a catastrophic fault.

  description:
    - Servers in general consume power and release it as heat, but when there are large variances in consumption because of workloads, the heat released from IT equipment also rises.
    - Therefore sudden fluctuations in server power consumption can cause dangerous increases in temperature, creating unplanned heat spots. While data centres have cooling systems, they may not be designed to handle specific localised hot spots. As temperature rises, equipment is likely to auto-shut down or act abnormally.
