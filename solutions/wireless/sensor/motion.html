        <p>Spook wireless motion sensors monitor motion by using passive infrared technology. This sensor is small so is
          perfect for discreet monitoring. It has a sensing range of approximately 5 metres and can be used to assist
          security or to monitor area activity.</p>

          <p>Sir Frederick William Herschel discovered Infrared radiation in 1800 which was described back then as
            "invisible radiation in the spectrum of light lower in energy than red light". He was aware of Sir Issac
            Newtonâ€™s discovery that sunlight could be separated into different colours using refraction through a glass
            prism.</p>

          <p>Herschel was investigating the differences in heat for each of the light forms he called the
            "thermometrical spectrum". In doing so he discovered that there was a temperature just beyond the red
            portion of the rainbow spectrum and found this area had the highest temperature of all. Herschel's
            experiments lead to the discovery of infrared light however the term infrared was coined approximately 75
            years later.</p>

          <p>Modern Passive IR (PIR) sensors use a pair of pyroelectric sensors (the ability of certain materials to
            generate an electrical potential when they are heated or cooled) to detect heat energy. The two sensors are
            beside each other, and when the signal differential between the two sensors changes, for example if a person
            enters the room, the sensor invokes a switch.</p>

              1822)</strong></p>
