    <p>Spook's cellular router solution won the recent 2020 CIR Business Continuity Awards category of "Specialist
      Technology
      Company of the Year".</p>

    <p>Unlike a standard router that accesses the internet through a cable, a cellular router enables you to get
      internet
      access through a cellular data network.</p>

    <p>This is perfect for keeping remote monitoring independent of a customers ethernet network or for areas where
      broadband
      is not an option.</p>

    <h2>Data Roaming SIM technology</h2>
    <p>Spook includes as standard a data roaming sim at no cost for usage. The sim has over 80 service providers
      including O2,
      Three, Vodafone and EE.</p>

    <h2>Data resilience</h2>
    <p>By only using data sims the signal required to transmit readings to Spook's remote cloud servers can be
      surprisingly weak.</p>
    <p>For areas where there is no mobile signal external aerials can be added or the cellular router can be installed
      anywhere
      within a customers facility where signal may be achieved.</p>

    <h2>Try before you buy</h2>
    <p>Spook can provide a loan cellular router to try before you decide to buy one. This ensures the cellular router
      proves
      its ability to work before you buy it.</p>

    <h2>Contingency</h2>
    <p>Spook cellular routers reboot and hunt for the strongest signal in the area every 24 hours so if a new mobile
      service
      provider pops up in the vicinity with a stronger signal, it is selected automatically.</p>

    <p>Also, if the current mobile service provider has a sudden loss of service Spook has designed a handy feature to
      auto-hunt for an alternative service provider within ten minutes of signal loss.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Each cellular router is set to send data securely via Spook's VPN.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Spook's standard cellular routers come with 4 x on-board LAN ports as standard. Simply connect the device that
      requires
      monitoring into one of the available LAN ports.</p>

    <p>For organisations that require more than 4 connections, multi-port switches can be added to the base unit to
      provide
      extended LAN ports.</p>

    <h2>Plug and play</h2>
    <p>Spook pre-configures the cellular routers to work with our award winning cloud based monitoring service called
      OmniWatch. So simply provide power and turn on the cellular router for instant access to your OmniWatch real time
      monitoring service.</p>
