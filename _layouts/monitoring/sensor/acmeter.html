				<p>Spook Wireless AC Current Meters measure the RMS (Root Mean Square) current of an AC system using a current transformer (CT) that wraps around the "hot" wire of a two wire (hot, common, ground) power system. The sensor reports minimum RMS current, maximum RMS	current, average RMS current, and amp hours.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measures amp hours, max RMS current, min RMS current, and average RMS current.
					<li>Capable of generating Watt Hour or Kilowatt Hour readings
					<li>Data logging for accumulated amp hour readings.
					<li>Can notify based on current levels or changes in current levels.
					<li>Measures current from 0 - 20 Amps.
