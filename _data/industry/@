      - There is a wide breadth of heritage organisations such as museums, galleries, libraries, private collections and archives. Each have their own careful considerations towards discrete monitoring. While on display exhibits and collections are vulnerable to environmental damage and theft. Whilst not on display items are stored in archives and are mostly left unattended until they are needed or for manual examination to ensure their security. Great care needs to be taken to ensure a collections longevity. While some damages are inevitable, most areas can gain huge benefits from remote monitoring.

      - Controlling the temperature of food is extremely important in ensuring that food is safe to eat. Government guidelines are set to ensure that food is always cooked, cooled, chilled or reheated properly to minimise the risk of harmful levels of bacteria in the food sold to members of the public. Meat products are typically regarded as high risk, but dried goods such as rice and pulses, vegetables and salads are also likely to contain bacteria that may grow if the food is subject to poor temperature control.

      - The very nature of a construction site often means expensive material and machinery is stored on-site, and sometimes even off grid. Construction sites typically have considerable investment made in vehicles and machinery. Often the busiest of locations suffer the greater losses as perpetrators can be hidden by local activity in the area. Construction sites suffer the need to apply high levels of security in the most inconvenient and challenging of conditions whether it is in cities or in remote rural locations.
      - Knowing doors, windows and gates are shut by installing open/closed sensors is helpful. Monitoring human activity via infrared remote sensors or vehicles by using wireless activity sensors or vehicle detection/counting sensors. Know if equipment moved, didn't, or if it suddenly moved when it shouldn't. Track activity of motors, machines, pumps & other vital assets to track processes are running smoothly or if maintenance is needed.

      - Boats or yachts are expensive but enjoyable investments and are in constant danger considering they are floating on water most of the time. In addition to daily maintenance, there are yearly inspections of parts of the boat which are not so easy to observe. The vast majority of boat problems stem from the engines, issues with improper cooling, or electrical failure. Most of these mechanical parts are not easily accessible and wouldn't necessarily be something that is easily checked while out on the water.

      - Many buildings have extensive plumbing with pressurised water being processed around the facility. Knowing if there is a burst water pipe or leaking boiler is often difficult and usually only noticed when there is a deluge and considerable damage. Temperature is also a key factor to ensure pipework and water tanks are not frozen during winter months. This is particularly challenging for older grade listed or heritage buildings whose plumbing can be many decades old.

      - Businesses, buildings, construction sites, schools and many more institutions all have their own priorities and reasons for access monitoring. Whether it is for human or vehicle activity, access monitoring is usually required from a security perspective. Add into the mix that access monitoring has different dynamics for different scenarios can become complicated, for instance monitoring access to a building has a different characteristic to monitoring the same for an area that is fenced or open-plan.

      - Vets premises need to store drugs and medicines securely. Knowing they are stored in adequate environmental conditions to ensure longevity together with ensuring they are locked in appropriate rooms and cabinets is very important. Vets also need to cater for short term animal occupancy for when pets and other creatures need to be operated on or to recuperate. Ensuring these areas do not get too hot and cause heat exhaustion for their occupants is of prime concern. Also, when animals are recuperating from an operation they are often sedated and remain motionless until the sedation abates. Being able to monitor motion in a recovery area saves time and effort in staff needing to remember to take a look to check matters whilst they maintain their busy veterinary schedules. Veterinarians working in enclosed spaces in winter months (eg, intensive animal production facilities) being heated by combustion sources will most commonly be exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) together with the animals they are treating. CO is colourless and has no odour so monitoring for its presence is crucial.

      - The food service industry is varied and wide. From cafes and coffee shops to food halls and restaurants, all have common and specific areas where remote monitoring will be hugely beneficial. Food preparation for consumption to members of the public comes with regulatory requirements; whilst ensuring the quality and longevity of food, especially perishable foodstuff in terms of refrigeration is important to measure. Food safety is paramount, ensuring food has not deteriorated or been tampered with can be critical.

      - Maintaining a complex heating and cooling system can be a major challenge. Not knowing when your HVAC system needs attention can be costly and repairing or recovering from a faulty system can be a burden both in terms of money for the repair or replacement kit and the resource in terms of labour time and effort. Since the Covid-19 epidemic in 2020 airflow monitoring is fast becoming a necessity. According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation.

      - The manufacturing industry is perhaps the biggest beneficiary for remote monitoring than any other business type. That's because the manufacturing sector has the largest breadth of business types, from food and household goods to automotive, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and everything in-between. They usually have the most disparate requirement to monitor equipment than any other organisation. Spook's remote monitoring service, called OmniWatch,  is protocol neutral and manufacturer independent. It provides an easy to use, joined-up, intuitive monitoring solution. Many machines and equipment types used in the manufacturing industry are not network connected and rely on dry contact panels and independent monitoring of differing sensor types to create to a cohesive and enterprise centric monitoring.

      - In Spook's experience most IT department staff are located some distance from the actual data centre/server room, often in a different part of the business, or sometimes in a different part of the country or world. Physical visits to the server rooms are therefore rare and normally confined to when on-site work is actually required.
      - This is known as running a lights out operation which is increasingly common; however it can result in IT staff not being 100% up to date on the the current environmental state of the server room.
      - By monitoring the server room environment, IT managers and their teams can ensure they are immediately aware of key changes as and when they occur, giving them that valuable early warning time to take remedial action before the incident impacts IT uptime.
      - Once alerted, even the simplest of actions, such as opening doors and windows or installing temporary fans to help with air flow should air conditioning units fail can often be an adequate first step in helping to avert business downtime.
      - During the Covid-19 crisis of 2020 this increased to over 99% of the time with IT departments happy to know there was an issue as long as they could keep a remote eye on matters and track the situation in real-time whilst lock-down procedures meant very limited on-site visits were permissible.
