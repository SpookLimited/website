  - The Hall-effect is named after the physicist Edwin Hall who discovered the effect while he was studying a doctoral degree at University. In 1879 he discovered that when a conductor or semiconductor with current flowing in one direction was introduced perpendicular to a magnetic field a voltage could be measured at right angles to the current path.
