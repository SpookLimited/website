# Dew point monitoring

Dew point is the temperature at which water vapour in the air starts condensing on equipment. Environments with high relative humidity (RH) and rapid changes in temperature are most likely to experience condensing humidity. Dew point is always expressed as a temperature (Â°C).

There are many reasons to measure dew point but perhaps the most common is when there is a requirement to monitor air cooling units in an area to reduce energy consumption.

## Demand contention

In an unmonitored room containing several Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units, it is possible to have half the room's cooling units adding humidity while the other half work to reduce it.

This condition is known as demand contention and is one of the primary causes of excessive energy consumption in IT environments.

Dew point control of relative humidity (RH) greatly reduces the frequency of demand contention. This is due to the fact that as air increases in temperature its dew point stays the same.

## How can Spook help?

Many organisations already have various ways to measure dew point and use Spook's remote monitoring service called OmniWatch to centrally manage their sensors. OmniWatch is manufacturer independent and protocol neutral and makes monitoring dew point from many different sensor manufacturers easy and intuitive.

OmniWatch is cloud based and alerts users when key changes to the sensor readings are monitored.

> We have installed Computer Room Air Conditioning units to ensure air cooling redundancy and to help compensate each other when a unit becomes stressed or less efficient. We found monitoring dewpoint to be a helpful measurement in order to reduce demand contention. OmniWatch checks dew point as well as keeping an eye on temperature, this helps ensure our server room is energy efficient.

## Not got dew point monitoring yet?

For organisations that have dew point monitoring requirements but haven't yet invested in dew point sensors; Spook's wireless dual humidity and temperature sensors are perfect. By knowing the temperature and humidity, Spook auto-calculates dew point. They are easy to install and come pre-configured so they only need to be switched on to provide immediate real-time monitoring and alerting.
