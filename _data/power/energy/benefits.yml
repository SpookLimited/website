  description:
    - Utility companies typically measure power as the average demand over 15 minutes. This is done by adding up the energy consumed and then dividing by the interval of time, giving units of power, kW.
    - The highest average 15 minute period of demand over a month is known as peak demand. Spook smart sensors can automate the whole process and present this in real-time and in auto daily, weekly or monthly reports.

    - Predictive maintenance directly traces an asset's health, status, and performance in real time.
    - By monitoring an assets on-demand operating conditions can reduce unexpected breakdowns and presents the opportunity to plan maintenance around a production schedule.

- name: Asset optimisation

  description:
    - Asset optimisation measures key equipment operating metrics. It helps to improve efficiency and reduce downtime. Operating margins are maximised by reducing the susceptibility for unplanned outages and helps to ensure the longevity of an assets life.
    - Labour costs associated with repairs or replacing high value assets are costly. Understanding when to plan a maintenance program on expensive assets can extend their lifecycle by up to 40% and improve productivity by up to 20%.

- name: Anomaly detection
  color: orange

  description:
    - By monitoring energy consumption down to asset level means any operating anomalies are rapidly identified, from efficiency degradation to catastrophic outages.
    - By understanding these anomalies gives organisations valuable thinking and reaction time to events that, if left unnoticed, could cause operational downtime.
