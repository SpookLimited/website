  words:
    - Lighting an environment is often a complex task, principally considered during the design stage of the building. However, lighting should be designed for the tasks that individuals are carrying out within that environment.
    - Guides to lighting can seem very complex technical documents, however, employers can take some simple steps to ensure staff and visitors have adequate lighting to carry out their tasks.

  words:
    - Different activities require different levels of light. In general, the more detailed the task, the greater the light requirement. A process control room should be lit at an illuminance of 300 lux, a corridor or walkway may only require 50 lux, whilst studying an engineering drawing may require 750 lux.
    - Where individuals are carrying out different activities, they will need control over their local lighting; for example a control and instrumentation engineer coming into a process control room lit at 300 lux may need a desk with a lamp to study a wiring diagram.

  words:
    - Studies have shown that giving workers in open plan offices local control of lighting can increase job satisfaction and consequently decrease their experience of stress.
    - Directional sources of light can bounce off reflective surfaces such as display screens and cause glare. Using blinds, correcting the angle of the source of light and using glare filters can help control this such as using up-lighting.

  words:
    - Lights being turned on can be a good indication that a person is present in a certain area when you are not expecting or wanting them to be.
    - Setting up alerts to track light usage within areas where people are unwanted acts as further security and peace of mind for the protection of valuable and vulnerable items.
    - This can, of course, be complemented by installing boundary and IR sensors, motion detection and conventional door access monitoring.
