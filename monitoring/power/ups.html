        <h3>Remote information</h3>
        <p>Most UPS systems have their own on-board data management software. However, the majority of these are data loggers and track UPS metrics for a limited amount of time. </p>
        <p>Organisations tend to have various UPS assets installed from many different manufacturers. This can become complicated for end users as each UPS has its own unique way of presenting data.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch is designed to passively collect UPS power metrics and present them in a standard, easy to understand, digital dashboard. Comparing and understanding UPS power metrics has never been so easy.</p>

        <h3>Critical alerting</h3>
        <p>When mains incoming power is lost or interruption to the mains supply occurs it is very important to act quickly. OmniWatch sends alerts to key members of staff at the very moment the UPS takes over power provision, providing as much warning as possible.</p>
        <p>Most UPS units only have enough battery autonomy for a short period of time and if there is no diesel generator to take over long term power provision or the return of the mains supply is delayed, then reducing non-critical loads in controlled power down procedures will help keep important equipment up and running longer.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch broadcasts alerts via email, SMS and UK call centre.</p>

        <h3>UPS health monitoring</h3>
        <p>Alongside monitoring power outages OmniWatch monitors the health of a UPS and is configured to alert to conditions and incidents that could otherwise go unnoticed such as faulty batteries.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch works to keep its users informed and up-to-date with the operational health of all their equipment. All UPS readings are stored in perpetuity so studying long term trend data is easy. </p>
        <p>In short, OmniWatch makes measuring energy related monitoring meaningful, intuitive and incredibly easy.</p>

        <h2>Maximise your investment</h2>
        <p>Most modern UPS systems have the ability to have a communications card installed within it to allow third party service providers to connect and share metrics and usage data.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch is capable of monitoring these cards and their UPS units, either through SNMP, Modbus, BACnet or other protocols.</p>
        <p>OmniWatch works with all communications protocols to allow for a cloud based, enterprise centric solution and not force users to be reliant on localised equipment manufacturers web interfaces.</p>
        <p>Even UPS systems that are not network attached can be monitored via a Voltage Free Connection (VFC) panel to monitor a wide range of UPS metrics.</p>

          <p>During recent roadworks the mains power was lost to our London server room. Thanks to OmniWatch our IT team in the Midlands could monitor our UPS systems in London to ensure they were providing back-up power during the outage.</p>
          <p>We could keep an eye on each power phase as well as knowing the time remaining on each UPS. Afterwards we could produce audit reports to prove to management that our UPS systems continued seamless power provision in accordance with our plans.</p>
