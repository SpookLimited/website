		<p>Spook wireless temperature sensors use a thermistor to accurately measure temperatures. These sensors are perfect for monitoring ambient temperatures around the sensors physical location.</p>
		<p>There are temperature probe versions that come with a length of cable attaching the probe to the sensor. A quad temperature probe sensor provides four independent points of temperature monitoring within the single unit.</p>
