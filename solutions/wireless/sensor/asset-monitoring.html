        <p>Spook wireless asset sensors trace the movement of assets within a facility. OmniWatch sends <a
            href="/omniwatch/alerting/">an alert</a> if an asset is removed from the operating range of the wireless
          gateway.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the sensor can detect the presence of a magnetic strip on an asset. If the magnetic source is
          broken, the asset sensor will send an alert.</p>

          <p>The reed switch was invented in 1936 and patented in 1941 by Walter B. Ellwood who was employed by Bell
            Telephone Laboratories. Walter was trying to design a cheap and easily replaceable relay for switching
            telecommunications traffic and came up with the design.</p>

          <p>The contacts of a reed switch are set to normally open (NO) and when the magnetic field of the reed switch
            is broken it changes to normally closed (NC). The reed is the metal part inside the switch and is relatively
            thin and wide in order to make it flexible. It resembles parts of some reed plants like the bull rush hence
            its name.</p>
