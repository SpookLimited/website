				<h3>Coin cell | AA | Industrial</h3>
                <p>Spook wireless open/closed sensors are ideal to monitor the status of an open/closed connection. The sensor has a magnetic switch attached via an interconnecting cable and detects whether there is a magnetic field or not.</p>
                <p>The magnetic contacts are usually normally open (NO) and when closed a magnetic field is detected. Alternatively they can be set to normally closed (NC) and trigger <a href="/omniwatch/alerting/">an alert</a> when the connection becomes open.</p>
