    <h2>Hassle free on-demand reporting</h2>
    <p>OmniWatch's on-demand reports are easy to use management accessories. They convert real-time sensor readings and equipment metrics into handy bite sized or custom designed time frames.</p>
    <p>Sensor readings are converted to charts showing the trend data for like-for-like sensor types regardless of the origin of the data. This makes comparing similar reading across different equipment easy and intuitive.</p>

  <h2>Cohesive reporting</h2>
  <p>Studying trend data within the reports can be influential in future proofing the monitored area. For example, by studying the power load of individual power strips can assist in proactive load balancing projects; or by checking the cooling efficiency of air conditioning units can help maintenance processes or provide valuable information to support equipment upgrades.</p>
  <p>Included within the report is a summary of every monitored condition with a record of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum reading</li>
    <li>Minimum reading</li>
    <li>Average reading</li>
    <li>Number of readings</li>
    <li>How many alarms have been generated per sensor</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="is-row">
    <div class="is-col">
      <h3>Alarms</h3>
      <p>Alarms are recorded within the reports and each alarm can be interrogated via a link showing each one in detail, including who were sent the alarms, which alarm stage they reached; together with the detail of who, within the team, reacted to the alarm. Any alarms associated within the time frame of the on-demand report are captured and published.</p>

      <h3>Audits</h3>
      <p>It's important to keep a track on any changes to the set-up of OmniWatch. All changes are date and time stamped together with cataloging the reason for the amendment and who applied them.</p>
      <p>This is critical to understanding why changes have been applied from simply amending the high temperature trigger point of a temperature sensor to tracking a rota change or updating an email address of a key contact. All changes are captured within the relevant report.</p>

      <div class="is-col is-70">
	<p>Monitoring the environment of an area is typically associated with measuring temperature, humidity and dew point although this can extend to monitoring water ingress and light levels too. The types of equipment that have sensors associated with monitoring the climate are varied. For example, temperature monitoring can be measured by climate monitors, UPS systems, intelligent power strips, refrigerators, cooling systems and more; the list is considerable. Being able to group and compare readings can be difficult but with OmniWatch on-demand reports, the ability to compare, filter and study trend data across common sensor types is simple.</p>
	<p>OmniWatch's on demand reports automatically group sensor types together for ease of use. Each sensor source can be filtered to provide a focused comparison; for example, only temperate sensors from cooling systems can be filtered as a subset of all temperature sensors.</p>

	<h2>Power monitoring reports</h2>
	<p>Power monitoring and load balancing measurements can be collected from various types of power equipment such as intelligent PDUs, power meters, UPS systems and generators. When measuring power metrics, intuitive comparisons can be made for any type of power metric but the most common are; amps, volts, kWh and stranded power.</p>
	<p>This means a true measurement of power efficiency gains can be captured across any time frame. This is extremely helpful in applying active load balancing exercises in order to prevent power loss due to a circuit breaking or due to power overload. The ability to unlock stranded power is key to maximising power usage before having to invest in expansion programs.</p>

	  <h2>Report accessibility</h2>
	  <p>OmniWatch filters access rights to data for on demand reports based upon a users credentials. Where multiple locations, rooms or even sensor types are monitored the ability to grade the information a user has access to is pre-configured. This means users only have access to data they are qualified to see under their remote, cloud based user accounts. On demand reports filter out any non-approved information automatically making interdepartmental, regional or confidential reports accessible only to those individuals who are qualified to see them.</p>

	  <h2>Custom time frames</h2>
	  <p>OmniWatch on-demand reports can be customised to cover any time frame that the user requires. Unlike most other monitoring solutions OmniWatch stores all sensor readings in perpetuity making analysis over long periods of time easily available.</p>
	  <p>Report time frames are pre-configured for immediate access:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The last 2, 7 or 30 days</li>
	    <li>Monthly reports</li>
	    <li>Week/month to date</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Users are also able to customise their own time frame by selecting start and stop dates; this is especially helpful if there is a requirement to measure multiple months/years within a single report or focus the report to just a few hours.</p>

    <h2>Warranty protection</h2>
    <p>One of the most common reasons for creating on-demand reports is for auditing purposes and for evidence that equipment types are being kept correctly within a manufacturers guidelines. By being able to audit the operating environment of equipment over large time frames means warranties can be protected.</p>
