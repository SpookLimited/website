        <p>Spook wireless open/closed sensors are ideal to monitor the status of an open/closed connection. The sensor
          has a magnetic switch attached via an interconnecting cable and detects whether there is a magnetic field or
          not.</p>
        <p>The magnetic contacts are usually normally open (NO) and when closed a magnetic field is detected.
          Alternatively they can be set to normally closed (NC) and trigger <a href="/omniwatch/alerting">an alert</a>
          when the connection becomes open.</p>

          <p>The reed switch was invented in 1936 and patented in 1941 by Walter B. Ellwood who was employed by Bell
            Telephone Laboratories. Walter was trying to design a cheap and easily replaceable relay for switching
            telecommunications traffic and came up with the design.</p>

          <p>The contacts of a reed switch are set to normally open (NO) and when the magnetic field of the reed switch
            is broken it changes to normally closed (NC). The reed is the metal part inside the switch and is relatively
            thin and wide in order to make it flexible. It resembles parts of some reed plants like the bull rush hence
            its name.</p>
