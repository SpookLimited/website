      - There is a wide breadth of heritage organisations such as museums, galleries, libraries, private collections and archives. Each have their own careful considerations towards discrete monitoring. While on display exhibitions and collections are vulnerable to environmental damage and theft. Whilst not on display items are usually stored in archives and are mostly left unattended until they are needed or for manual examination to ensure their condition and security. Great care needs to be taken to ensure a collections longevity. While some damages are inevitable, most areas can gain huge benefits from remote monitoring.
      - Spook's remote monitoring service, called OmniWatch, helps by remotely monitoring key areas and sending real-time alarms to events that need immediate attention.

      - Refrigeration is often overlooked as an industry but it spans food processing to drug and medicine production and storage. In terms of controlling the temperature of its contents a refrigeration unit is extremely important. In the food industry government guidelines are set to ensure that food is always cooked, cooled, chilled or reheated properly to minimise the risk of harmful levels of bacteria in the food sold to members of the public. In the medical industry drugs and medicines need to be stored in cool, dry conditions to protect their composition.

      - Construction sites usually need to monitor health and safety regulations as a prerequisite. Being able to prove, via audit, these regulations are met can be massively helpful. Construction sites typically store expensive material and machinery on-site too, so issues of security are equally important. Often the busiest of locations suffer the greatest losses as perpetrators can hide their intentions while they scrutinise areas of opportunity hidden by the activity of innocent bystanders. Whilst rural locations are easy targets for theft due to their remoteness. Knowing doors, windows and gates are shut is helpful as well as monitoring human and vehicle activity.

      - Agricultural businesses range from precision agriculture organisations to traditional farms and farmland. The very nature of an agricultural organisation often means their livelihood is achieved in rural locations, and sometimes even off grid. There is considerable investment made in vehicles and machinery too. Being rural brings with it its own complications. Agricultural crime covers working farms, farm machinery, farm buildings and smallholdings.

      - Boats or yachts are expensive but enjoyable investments and are in constant danger considering they are floating on water most of the time. In addition to daily maintenance, there are yearly inspections of parts of the boat which are not so easy to observe. The vast majority of boat problems stem from the engines, issues with improper cooling, or electrical failure. Most of these mechanical parts are not easily accessible and wouldn't necessarily be something that is easily checked while out on the water.

      - Many aspects of Biotech and Pharma (B&P) organisations are regulated. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom (UK) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America (USA) are the two largest regulatory authorities with responsibility in their respective countries. They work closely with each other to maintain compliance of B&P organisations. B&P's often need to prove that their products have been maintained in strictly controlled environments. This often requires a significant expense in the implementation and overhead for advanced environmental monitoring systems.

      - Boilers come in all shapes and sizes but all must maintain a certain temperature level for safe, reliable and effective operations. Boilers typically have four main components; the burner, the combustion chamber, the heat exchanger and the pluming apparatus and they distribute pressurised water around the system. Old or improperly maintained boilers they often develop heavy duty leaks due to the pressurised environment. Most industrial boilers reside in a dedicated room, however this is usually a room where no one goes until there is a problem.

      - Establishments such as churches, cathedrals, mosques, mandir’s, synagogues and other places of worship are very difficult to protect all year-round. Many stay unoccupied for the majority of time and contain valuable and irreplaceable possessions. Even during times of worship protecting valuables and items of heritage importance can be a struggle.

      - Many buildings have extensive plumbing with pressurised water being processed around the facility. Water ingress has one of the most disruptive environmental conditions that can be monitored. This is because the effects of unwanted water are immediate and sometimes long-lasting. Once the cause of water ingress has been addressed the drying out process can be protracted and in some cases dangerous. Temperature is also a key factor to ensure pipework and water tanks are not frozen during winter months. This is particularly challenging for older grade listed or heritage buildings whose plumbing can be many decades old.

      - Many organisations have their own priorities and reasons for access monitoring. Whether it is for human or vehicle activity, access monitoring is usually required from a security perspective. Add into the mix that access monitoring has different dynamics for different scenarios can become complicated. For instance, monitoring access to a building has a different characteristic to monitoring the same for an area that is fenced or open-plan. Even access rights vary for rural or city based monitoring. Rural based monitoring usually has to account for lack of electricity and communications whereas city based monitoring has to contend with high foot-fall and localised activity in the vicinity.
      - Spook's remote monitoring service, called OmniWatch, helps by remotely monitoring access in both scenarios sending real-time alarms to events that could compromise security.

      - Vets premises need to store drugs and medicines securely. Knowing they are stored in adequate environmental conditions to ensure longevity together with ensuring they are locked in appropriate rooms and cabinets is very important. Vets also need to cater for short term animal occupancy for when pets and other creatures need to be operated on or to recuperate. Ensuring these areas do not get too hot and cause heat exhaustion for their occupants is of prime concern. Also, when animals are recuperating from an operation they are often sedated and remain motionless until the sedation abates. Being able to monitor motion in a recovery area saves time and effort in staff needing to remember to take a look to check matters whilst they maintain their busy veterinary schedules. Veterinarians working in enclosed spaces in winter months (eg, intensive animal production facilities) being heated by combustion sources will most commonly be exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) together with the animals they are treating. CO is colourless and has no odour so monitoring for its presence is crucial.

      - The food service industry is varied and wide. From cafes and coffee shops to food halls and restaurants, all have common and specific areas where remote monitoring is hugely beneficial. Food preparation for public consumption comes with regulatory requirements; whilst ensuring the quality and longevity of food, especially perishable foodstuff, monitoring refrigeration is an important measurement. Food security is also paramount, ensuring food has not deteriorated or been tampered with is critical for safe consumption. Monitoring access to confined areas as well as ensuring doors and access points are protected all contribute to the protection of the food chain in the food services.
      - Spook's remote monitoring service, called OmniWatch, helps by remotely monitoring many aspects of food safety and security and sending real-time alarms for events that require immediate attention.

      - Maintaining a complex heating and cooling system can be a major challenge. Not knowing when your HVAC system needs attention can be costly and repairing or recovering from a faulty system can be a burden both in terms of money for the repair or replacement kit and the resource in terms of labour time and effort. Another important factor is that since the Covid-19 epidemic in 2020 airflow monitoring is fast becoming a necessity. According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation (more).

      - The manufacturing industry is perhaps the biggest beneficiary for remote monitoring than any other business type. Thats because the manufacturing sector has the largest breadth of business types, from food and household goods to automotive, pharmaceuticals and aerospace and everything in-between. Manufacturing organisations have a plethora of different equipment types, dependent of their manufacturing activity. They usually have to monitor disparate hardware too. Spook’s remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is designed to be protocol neutral and works with SNMP, BACnet, Modbus, XML, Jason and others. For equipment that is not network attached, fitting dry contact sensors to monitor equipment is extremely helpful.

      - IT departments are often at the vanguard of maximising the uptime of their services to their business, users and customers alike. Typically IT staff are located some distance from the actual data centre/server room, often in a different part of the business, or sometimes in a different part of the country or world. Physical visits to the server rooms are therefore rare and normally confined to when on-site work is actually required. This is known as running a lights out operation which is increasingly common. During the Covid-19 crisis of 2020 IT rooms were left unattended for over 99% of the time.
      - Spook's remote monitoring service, called OmniWatch, helps by remotely monitoring the operating environment of IT rooms and sending real-time alarms for events that require immediate attention.

      - Both IT & facility management departments share similar concerns regarding the monitoring of physical equipment and their general environment. The topic of monitoring systems across the entire facility means the net of equipment that can be monitored is varied and wide. It's important to have a monitoring solution that is meaningful and uncomplicated. Hard facility services are ones which relate to the physical fabric of the building and cannot easily be removed. They ensure the safety and welfare of employees and generally are required by law.
