page-description: Spook wireless VDC meters are used for measuring the voltage of third party devices and batteries. There are a range of different sensor voltages available but the most common Spook meter measures voltage up to 5 VDC.
did-you-know:
  - Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were caught up in a battle now known as the War of the Currents during the 1880s. Edison developed a current that runs continually along a single direction (Direct Current) whereas Tesla developed alternating current (AC). The problem with DC is it is not easily converted to high or low voltages and therefore not efficient at large scale distribution. 
  - AC was favoured as the standard for home and office use as it can be converted to various voltages using transformers. However, in recent years DC has had a renaissance as its used in many common appliances such as LEDs, computers, solar cells and electric vehicles. 
  - Nowadays methods are now available for converting direct current to higher and lower voltages and as DC is more stable than AC, organisations are finding ways of using high voltage direct current (HVDC) to transport electricity long distances with less electricity loss.
