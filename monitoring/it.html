                <h2>Secure cloud based IT equipment and infrastructure monitoring</h2>
                <p>Spook's cloud based remote monitoring service called OmniWatch is chiefly deployed in data centers
                    and IT server rooms. It is generally well known that the majority of business disruption is caused
                    by unplanned IT downtime.</p>
                <p>By monitoring the key environmental and power elements of IT rooms housing critical equipment means
                    if there is an alarm, remedial action can take place to normalise matters in order to maximise
                    business uptime.</p>
                <p>Whether there is a requirement to monitor wired climate monitoring hardware or 3rd party devices such
                    as intelligent power strips, uninterruptible power supplies, generators, BMS systems and more;
                    OmniWatch provides an enterprise centric monitoring solution.</p>

        <h2>Disaster recovery</h2>
        <p>OmniWatch is designed with disaster avoidance in mind rather than disaster recovery (DR). Disaster avoidance
            is focused on monitoring key areas for early warnings to events that, if left unnoticed could easily
            escalate to invoking DR plans.</p>
        <p>By taking remedial actions at early stages of a problem means organisations can contain a situation and fix
            it with little or no disruption to its business.</p>
