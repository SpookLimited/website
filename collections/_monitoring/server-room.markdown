# Spook server room monitoring

OmniWatch remote monitoring reduces downtime and operating expense and increases equipment reliability and employee satisfaction.

A server room (sometimes referred to as a computer room) often houses business critical equipment. It is usually a secure, dedicated area built within an office building. As a consequence, the main utilities such as power, communications etc are normally a subset of those available to the building as a whole. Many server rooms have added power redundancy in the form of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) and Generator sets as well as diverse communication links.

Any interruption of the IT infrastructure could cause an organisation to suffer system downtime, loss of productivity as well as loss in revenue.

## Typical monitored conditions include

+ Temperature
+ Humidity
+ Water ingress
+ Door Access
+ Power

Simple actions, for example; such as opening doors and windows or installing temporary air conditioning units and fans in cases of high temperature are enough to prevent system failure and to present valuable thinking and reaction time to unforeseen events.

The added benefits of monitoring presents opportunities for day to day planning. For example, measuring power metrics allows for load balancing between racks as well as temperature monitoring providing valuable information in helping to locate new servers into areas that are not heat stressed.

> Spook provides peace of mind in that we can monitor all aspects of our server room in real time and review trends to identify areas that we can proactively address. We can rely on OmniWatch to immediately make us aware of any issues 24x7.
