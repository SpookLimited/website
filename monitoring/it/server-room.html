            <p>Server rooms (sometimes referred to as a computer rooms) are usually a secure, dedicated area built
              within an existing office building. As a consequence, the main utilities such as power and communications
              are normally a subset of those available to the building as a whole. Many server rooms have been designed
              with power and communications redundancy in order to provide continuous IT service delivery to their
              business.</p>

          <h2>Spook real-time monitoring</h2>
          <p>Any interruption of the IT infrastructure in a server room could cause an organisation to suffer system
            downtime, loss of productivity as well as loss in revenue. OmniWatch is designed to alert users to events
            that, if go unnoticed, could cause business interruption.</p>
          <p>Simple actions, for example; opening doors and windows or installing temporary air conditioning units and
            fans in cases of high temperature are enough to prevent system failure and to provide valuable thinking and
            reaction time to remedy matters.</p>
          <p>The added benefits of monitoring presents opportunities for day to day planning. For example, measuring
            power metrics means power load balancing between racks can be achieved as well as temperature monitoring
            providing valuable information in helping to locate new servers into areas that are not heat stressed.</p>

          <p>Many server rooms are left unattended for the majority of time, this is known as a lights out policy.
            Physical visits are usually confined to when work within the server room is actually required.</p>
          <p>When you take into consideration working patterns too, it is unusual for IT staff to be present
            out-of-office hours including weekends. This means a server room is typically left unoccupied for more than
            70% of the time.</p>

          <p>The Covid-19 epidemic of 2020 has meant more organisations are enforcing remote working policies than ever
            before.</p>
          <p>IT staff are familiar with remote access to servers and networks which makes them uniquely positioned to
            take advantage of more stringent remote working practices.</p>
          <p>OmniWatch assists by providing IT server room remote monitoring 24/7 which is ideal for staff working from
            home or whilst on the move.</p>
