        <p>Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated at 100 percent relative humidity. It is a
          calculation derived from relative humidity and temperature. If the dew point is below 0°C (32°F) its water
          vapour will become ice which point the the dew point is termed the frost point.</p>
        <p>Spook calculates dew point by installing a dual temperature and humidity (RH) sensor, the dew point is
          automatically calculated and expressed as °C. Try Spook's free <a
            href="/monitoring/environmental/dewpoint#dew-point-calculator">dew point
            calculator here</a>.</p>
        <p>The dual sensor monitors the values in a single casing and is made to a high scientific grade. It has a
          relative humidity accuracy of ± 3% (between 10%-90% RH) and a temperature accuracy of ± 1°C (1.8°F).</p>

          <p>Leonardo da Vinci created a hygrometer in the 1400s but it was crude and fairly inaccurate. It was Horace
            Bénédict de Saussure who accurately created a humidity sensor using human hair to measure wetness in the air
            in 1783. As the hair became wet it expanded and as it dried it contracted. However it was John Frederic
            Daniell, a British chemist and meteorologist who invented the dew point hygrometer in 1820.</p>
