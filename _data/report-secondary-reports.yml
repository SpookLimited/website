    - OmniWatch filters access rights to data for on demand reports based upon a users credentials. Where multiple locations, rooms or even sensor types are monitored the ability to grade the information a user has access to is pre-configured.
    - This means users only have access to data they are qualified to see under their remote, cloud based user accounts. On demand reports filter out any non-approved information automatically making interdepartmental, regional or confidential reports accessible only to those individuals who are qualified to see them.

    - OmniWatch on-demand reports can be customised to cover any time frame that the user requires. Unlike most other monitoring solutions OmniWatch stores all sensor readings in perpetuity making analysis over long periods of time easily available.
    - Report time frames are pre-configured for immediate access.
    - <ul><li>The last 2, 7 or 30 days</li><li>Monthly reports</li><li>Week/month to date</li></ul>
    - Users are also able to customise their own time frame by selecting start and stop dates; this is especially helpful if there is a requirement to measure multiple months/years within a single report or focus the report to just a few hours.
