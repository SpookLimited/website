While Sir Tim Waterstone shares the eight tracks, book and luxury that he would want to take with him if cast away to a desert island Spook ensures his legacy is protected by monitoring the IT interests of the business.

<blockquote>
<p>We have used Spook to monitor our IT environment for a number of years. During that time Waterstones has changed the landscape of our server rooms and centralised to our Piccadilly data centre in London. Spook have worked with us during this time and have continually developed their service over the years.</p>
<p>By subscribing to OmniWatch means we can monitor the London based facility from our Birmingham IT location easily. The server room is lights out so knowing the area is monitored 24/7 is extremely important.</p>
<p><small>Waterstones - The UK's only national bookshop chain.</small></p>

Occupying a beautiful art deco building, formerly Simpsons' department store, in the heart of London's West End, Waterstones Piccadilly offers six huge floors of books with over 200,000 unique titles.

There is truly something to be found for even the most discerning of readers, from Waterstones flagship Fiction, Travel, History and Art sections or from across the wider branch.

His book choice, The Oxford Book of English Verse, his luxury item, a photo of his wife and his favourite track, The Dream of Gerontius by Edward Elgar.
