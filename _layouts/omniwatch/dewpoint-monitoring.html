    <h2>The importance of dew point monitoring</h2>
    <p>Dew point is the temperature at which water vapour in the air starts condensing on the equipment. Environments with high <a href="/omniwatch/humidity-monitoring">relative humidity (RH)</a> and rapid changes in temperature are most likely to experience condensing humidity. Dew point is always expressed as a temperature (Â°C).</p>
