did-you-know:
  - Greek philosophers were aware of the principles of a thermometer over two thousand years ago when Philo (20 B.C. – 50 A.D.) who was a Jewish philosopher recorded early experiments on the expansion of air with heat. He designed a tube connected to a hollow sphere which was extended over a jug of water. The hollow sphere reacted to being heated by the water. 
  - However, the Italian physician Santorio Santorio is believed to be the inventor of the first thermometer in the form of a thermoscope although his famous colleague and friend Galileo Galilei is thought to have been a major contributor to the instruments design.
